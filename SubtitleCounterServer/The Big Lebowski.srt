00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:36,921
# See them
tumbling down #

2
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:40,939
# Pledging their love
to the ground #

3
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:43,439
A way out west
there was this fella,

4
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:45,818
fella I want
to tell you about,

5
00:00:45,818 --> 00:00:49,437
fella by the name
of Jeff Lebowski,

6
00:00:49,527 --> 00:00:51,436
at least that
was the handle

7
00:00:51,486 --> 00:00:53,445
That his loving parents
gave him.

8
00:00:53,445 --> 00:00:56,444
But he never had
much use for it himself.

9
00:00:56,524 --> 00:01:00,483
This Lebowski,
he called himself The Dude.

10
00:01:00,573 --> 00:01:04,452
Now Dude, that's a name
no one would self-apply

11
00:01:04,492 --> 00:01:06,451
where I come from.

12
00:01:06,531 --> 00:01:08,910
But then, there was
a lot about The Dude

13
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,949
that didn't make a whole
lot of sense to me,

14
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:14,868
and a lot about
where he lived, likewise.

15
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:18,447
But then again,

16
00:01:18,497 --> 00:01:22,536
maybe that's why I found the
place so dern interesting.

17
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:30,963
They call Los Angeles
The City of Angels.

18
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:33,962
I didn't find it
to be that exactly.

19
00:01:34,002 --> 00:01:37,920
But I'll allow there
are some nice folks there.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,839
'Course I can't
say I seen London,

21
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,759
And I never
been to France,

22
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,838
And I ain't never seen no
queen in her damned undies

23
00:01:45,928 --> 00:01:47,967
as the fella says.

24
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,886
But I'll tell you what,

25
00:01:49,886 --> 00:01:51,846
after seeing Los Angeles

26
00:01:51,886 --> 00:01:55,425
And this a-here story
I'm about to unfold,

27
00:01:55,475 --> 00:01:58,434
Well, I guess
I seen somethin'

28
00:01:58,513 --> 00:01:59,893
every bit as stupefyin'

29
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:02,432
as you'd see in any
of those other places,

30
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:04,931
and in English, too.

31
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:07,930
So I can die
with a smile on my face

32
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,519
without feeling like
the good Lord gypped me.

33
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:13,928
Now this here story
I'm about to unfold

34
00:02:14,018 --> 00:02:17,027
took place back
in the early nineties,

35
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:19,426
just about the time of
our conflict with Saddam

36
00:02:19,566 --> 00:02:21,486
and the Iraqis.

37
00:02:21,486 --> 00:02:25,365
I only mention it 'cause
sometimes there's a man,

38
00:02:25,365 --> 00:02:27,444
I won't say a hero,

39
00:02:27,444 --> 00:02:29,533
'Cause what's a hero?

40
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:31,992
But sometimes
there's a man,

41
00:02:32,072 --> 00:02:35,061
and I'm talking
about The Dude here,

42
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:37,950
sometimes there's a man,

43
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,409
he's the man
for his time and place.

44
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:45,538
He fits right in there,

45
00:02:45,618 --> 00:02:47,497
and that's The Dude,

46
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,496
in Los Angeles.

47
00:02:49,496 --> 00:02:53,035
And even if
he's a lazy man,

48
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,544
and The Dude was
most certainly that,

49
00:02:55,624 --> 00:02:59,043
quite possibly the laziest
in Los Angeles county,

50
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,043
which would place him
high in the running

51
00:03:01,123 --> 00:03:04,132
for laziest worldwide.

52
00:03:04,132 --> 00:03:07,001
But sometimes
there's a man,

53
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:10,469
sometimes...
There's a man.

54
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:15,008
Wow, lost my train
of thought here.

55
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:20,466
I done introduced
him enough.

56
00:03:20,516 --> 00:03:22,016
All for
a collective action.

57
00:03:22,056 --> 00:03:24,015
This will not stand.

58
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:25,554
This will not stand,

59
00:03:25,594 --> 00:03:28,143
this aggression
against Kuwait.

60
00:03:28,183 --> 00:03:34,061
# Here on the range
I belong #

61
00:03:34,101 --> 00:03:39,560
# Drifting along
with the tumbling #

62
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:46,647
# Tumbleweed #

63
00:03:57,534 --> 00:03:59,993
Where's the money,
Lebowski?

64
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:02,402
I want that money,
Lebowski.

65
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:05,071
Bunny says you're
good for it.

66
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:10,489
Where's the money,
Lebowski?

67
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:12,579
Where's the fucking
money, shithead?!

68
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:18,077
It's down there somewhere.
let me take another look.

69
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:21,796
Don't fuck with us!

70
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,084
Your wife owes money
to Jackie Treehorn,

71
00:04:25,084 --> 00:04:28,083
That means you own
money to Jackie Treehorn.

72
00:04:28,173 --> 00:04:31,172
Ever thus to
deadbeats, Lebowski.

73
00:04:31,462 --> 00:04:33,662
No, no, don't do that

74
00:04:34,461 --> 00:04:36,421
Not on the rug, man.

75
00:04:36,511 --> 00:04:37,460
See?

76
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,090
See what happens,
Lebowski?

77
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,049
You see what happens?

78
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:42,509
Nobody calls me
Lebowski.

79
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:45,967
You got the wrong guy.
I'm The Dude, man.

80
00:04:46,097 --> 00:04:48,007
Your name's
Lebowski, Lebowski.

81
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:49,966
Your wife is Bunny.

82
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:53,555
My my wife..
my wife Bunny?

83
00:04:53,555 --> 00:04:56,054
Do you see a wedding
ring on my finger?

84
00:04:56,054 --> 00:04:57,893
Does this place look
like I'm fucking married?

85
00:04:57,973 --> 00:05:00,563
The toilet seat's up,
man.

86
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,559
What the fuck
is this?

87
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:13,688
Obviously,
you're not a golfer.

88
00:05:14,568 --> 00:05:16,487
Woo?

89
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:20,856
Isn't this guy supposed
to be a millionaire?

90
00:05:23,195 --> 00:05:26,034
Yeah, what do you think?

91
00:05:26,074 --> 00:05:28,033
He looks like
a fucking loser.

92
00:05:28,113 --> 00:05:31,072
Hey, at least
I'm housebroken.

93
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:33,032
Fucking time wasted.

94
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,321
Thanks a lot,
asshole.

95
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:08,550
# The man in me will do #

96
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,969
# Nearly any task #

97
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:15,058
# And as for compensation #

98
00:06:15,098 --> 00:06:18,057
# There's a little
he would ask #

99
00:06:18,057 --> 00:06:21,475
# Take a woman like you #

100
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:24,015
# To get through #

101
00:06:24,015 --> 00:06:26,644
# To the man in me #

102
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:32,982
# The storm clouds
are raging #

103
00:06:32,982 --> 00:06:35,731
# All around my door #

104
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,480
# I think to myself #

105
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,528
# I might not
take it anymore #

106
00:06:42,608 --> 00:06:45,527
# Take a woman
like your kind #

107
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:50,816
# To find the man in me #

108
00:06:52,615 --> 00:06:55,614
# But, oh #

109
00:06:55,614 --> 00:06:58,613
# What a wonderful feeling #

110
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:05,121
# Just to know
that you are near #

111
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,749
# That sets
my heart a-reelin' #

112
00:07:12,618 --> 00:07:15,707
# From my toes #

113
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:19,586
# Up to my ears #

114
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:23,085
# The man in me
will hide sometimes #

115
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:26,124
# To keep from being seen #

116
00:07:26,174 --> 00:07:28,133
# But that's just because #

117
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:32,672
# He doesn't want to
turn into some machine #

118
00:07:32,712 --> 00:07:35,721
# Take a woman like you #

119
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,630
# To get through #

120
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,759
# To the man in me #

121
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:45,807
I'm throwing
rocks tonight.

122
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:47,307
Mark it, Dude.

123
00:07:47,347 --> 00:07:49,726
This was a valued rug.

124
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:51,345
This was a...

125
00:07:51,385 --> 00:07:53,854
Yeah, man, it really
tied the room together.

126
00:07:53,894 --> 00:07:55,814
So this was
a valued

127
00:07:55,854 --> 00:07:57,263
What tied the room
together, Dude?

128
00:07:57,313 --> 00:07:58,313
My rug.

129
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,812
Were you listening to
The Dude's story, Donny?

130
00:07:59,852 --> 00:08:00,852
What?

131
00:08:00,892 --> 00:08:02,232
Were you listening
to The Dude's story?

132
00:08:02,272 --> 00:08:03,851
I was bowling.

133
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,360
So you have no frame
of reference here, Donny.

134
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,770
You're like a child

135
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,359
who wanders in
in the middle of a movie

136
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,279
Walter, what's
the point, man?

137
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,238
There's no reason--
here's my point, Dude

138
00:08:12,278 --> 00:08:13,738
There's no fucking reason--

139
00:08:13,778 --> 00:08:15,317
Yeah, Walter,
what's your point?

140
00:08:15,777 --> 00:08:17,277
Walter, what
is the point--

141
00:08:17,277 --> 00:08:19,236
Look, we all know
who is at fault here.

142
00:08:19,276 --> 00:08:21,195
What the fuck are
you talking about?

143
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:23,235
No, what
the fuck are you--

144
00:08:25,364 --> 00:08:27,823
We're talking about unchecked
aggression here, Dude.

145
00:08:27,863 --> 00:08:29,243
What the fuck is
he talking about?

146
00:08:29,323 --> 00:08:30,412
My rug.

147
00:08:30,412 --> 00:08:31,872
Forget it, Donny.
you're out of your element.

148
00:08:31,872 --> 00:08:33,831
Walter, the chinaman
who peed on my rug,

149
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:35,910
I can't go
give him a bill.

150
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,830
So what the fuck
are you talking about?

151
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,249
What the fuck
are you talking about?

152
00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:41,289
The chinaman is not
the issue here, Dude.

153
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,248
I'm talking about drawing
a line in the sand, Dude.

154
00:08:43,248 --> 00:08:45,747
Across this line,
you do not--

155
00:08:45,747 --> 00:08:49,206
Also, Dude, chinaman is not
the preferred nomenclature.

156
00:08:49,336 --> 00:08:51,255
Asian-American,
please.

157
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:54,254
Walter, this isn't a guy
who built the railroads here,

158
00:08:54,294 --> 00:08:55,754
this is a guy

159
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:57,253
What the fuck
are you talking

160
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,753
Walter,
he peed on my rug.

161
00:08:58,843 --> 00:09:00,842
He peed on
The Dude's rug.

162
00:09:00,922 --> 00:09:02,801
Donny, you're
out of your element.

163
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:05,291
Dude, the chinaman
is not the issue here.

164
00:09:05,381 --> 00:09:06,330
So, ... who..

165
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,800
Jeff Lebowski.

166
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,299
The other
Jeffrey Lebowski,

167
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,259
the millionaire.

168
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,308
That's fucking
interesting, man.

169
00:09:12,308 --> 00:09:13,808
That's fucking
interesting.

170
00:09:13,808 --> 00:09:16,227
Plus, he has
the wealth, obviously,

171
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:17,846
and the resources,

172
00:09:17,846 --> 00:09:19,266
so that
there's no reason

173
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:20,845
there's no
fucking reason

174
00:09:20,925 --> 00:09:22,265
why his wife
should go out

175
00:09:22,265 --> 00:09:23,305
and owe money
all over town,

176
00:09:23,305 --> 00:09:24,224
and then they come

177
00:09:24,354 --> 00:09:26,314
and they pee on
your fucking rug!

178
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,353
Am I wrong? No.

179
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:28,393
Am I wrong?

180
00:09:29,313 --> 00:09:31,392
Ok, then.

181
00:09:31,392 --> 00:09:33,351
That rug really tied
the room together,

182
00:09:33,431 --> 00:09:35,360
Did it not?

183
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,300
Fuckin' a!

184
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,730
And this guy
peed on it.

185
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,779
Donny, please.

186
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:40,229
You know, this
is the fucking guy

187
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:41,818
I could find this
fucking Lebowski guy.

188
00:09:41,818 --> 00:09:43,238
His name is Lebowski?

189
00:09:43,318 --> 00:09:44,767
That's your name, Dude.

190
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,317
This is the guy

191
00:09:46,317 --> 00:09:48,196
who should compensate me
for the fucking rug.

192
00:09:48,196 --> 00:09:49,826
His wife goes out

193
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,285
and owes money
all over town,

194
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:52,735
and they pee on my rug?

195
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,824
They pee on
your fucking rug.

196
00:09:54,904 --> 00:09:56,233
They pee on
my fucking rug.

197
00:09:56,283 --> 00:09:57,783
That's right, Dude.

198
00:09:58,823 --> 00:10:01,442
They peed on
your fucking rug.

199
00:10:02,871 --> 00:10:04,161
This is the study.

200
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:06,160
As you can see,
the various commendations...

201
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,249
"Jeffrey Lebowski."

202
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:10,749
Honorary degrees,
etcetera.

203
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:12,168
very impressive.

204
00:10:12,248 --> 00:10:14,707
Oh, please feel free
to inspect them.

205
00:10:14,707 --> 00:10:16,667
Oh, no, I'm
not really that

206
00:10:16,707 --> 00:10:17,706
Oh, please, please.

207
00:10:17,756 --> 00:10:19,716
That is the key to
the city of Pasadena,

208
00:10:19,796 --> 00:10:21,675
Which Mr. Lebowski
received 2 years ago

209
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:24,794
In recognition of
his various civic ...

210
00:10:24,884 --> 00:10:27,373
Oh, that's
the Los Angeles

211
00:10:27,423 --> 00:10:29,452
Chamber of Commerce
Business Achiever Award,

212
00:10:29,502 --> 00:10:30,802
which is given

213
00:10:30,882 --> 00:10:32,221
oh, not necessarily
given every year.

214
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:35,760
Hey, is this, 
is this him with Nancy?

215
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,720
Yes, indeed,
that is Mr. Lebowski

216
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,799
with the first lady, yes.
it was taken when

217
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:42,768
That's, Lebowski
on the left there?

218
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,847
Yeah, of course.
Mr. Lebowski on the left

219
00:10:44,847 --> 00:10:46,347
so he's a cripple

220
00:10:46,347 --> 00:10:48,766
Uh, you know,
a handicapped guy?

221
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:50,805
Mr. Lebowski
is disabled, yes.

222
00:10:50,805 --> 00:10:52,305
Uh, this picture
was taken

223
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,854
when Mrs. Reagan was
first lady of the nation,

224
00:10:54,894 --> 00:10:57,353
Yes, yes.
Not of California.

225
00:10:57,353 --> 00:10:58,393
Pope John.

226
00:10:58,393 --> 00:11:00,232
..in fact, he met
privately with the President,

227
00:11:00,312 --> 00:11:01,232
though unfortunately,

228
00:11:01,232 --> 00:11:03,311
There wasn't enough time
for a photo opportunity.

229
00:11:03,311 --> 00:11:04,731
Oh, Nancy's pretty good.

230
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:06,770
Oh, wonderful woman.
we're very happy

231
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,820
these are ...

232
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,229
oh, those are Mr. Lebowski's
children, so to speak.

233
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:12,278
Different mothers, huh?

234
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:13,778
Racially, pretty cool.

235
00:11:15,277 --> 00:11:17,236
They're not literally
his children.

236
00:11:17,326 --> 00:11:19,726
They're the little
Lebowski Urban Achievers,

237
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:21,365
Inner-city children
of promise

238
00:11:21,365 --> 00:11:22,735
but without
the necessary means for

239
00:11:22,824 --> 00:11:24,824
necessary means for
a higher education.

240
00:11:24,904 --> 00:11:26,863
So Mr. Lebowski
is committed

241
00:11:26,863 --> 00:11:28,703
to sending all
of them to college.

242
00:11:28,782 --> 00:11:29,742
Excuse me.

243
00:11:29,832 --> 00:11:31,702
Thank you. Thank you.

244
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,661
Far out.

245
00:11:32,661 --> 00:11:34,751
Think he's got room
for one more?

246
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:39,369
You never
went to college.

247
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:40,788
Please,
don't touch that.

248
00:11:40,878 --> 00:11:42,588
Yeah, no, I did,
but, you know,

249
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,587
I spent most
of my time, um,

250
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:46,587
occupying various
administration buildings,

251
00:11:46,587 --> 00:11:49,046
smoking a lot
of thai stick,

252
00:11:49,086 --> 00:11:50,585
breaking into
the R.O.T.C.,

253
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,085
and bowling.

254
00:11:52,085 --> 00:11:53,634
to tell you
the truth, Brandt,

255
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,044
I don't remember
most of it.

256
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:04,051
Ok, sir, you're a Lebowski,
I'm a Lebowski,

257
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:05,010
That's terrific.

258
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,469
But I'm very busy,
as I imagine you are.

259
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:11,428
What can I
do for you, sir?

260
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:13,388
Uh, well, sir,
it's,

261
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:15,017
this rug I have.

262
00:12:15,057 --> 00:12:17,556
It really tied
the room together.

263
00:12:17,596 --> 00:12:19,605
You told Brandt on
the phone, he told me.

264
00:12:19,645 --> 00:12:22,065
Where do I fit in?

265
00:12:22,105 --> 00:12:23,524
Well, they were

266
00:12:23,564 --> 00:12:24,974
They were looking
for you, these 2 guys.

267
00:12:26,523 --> 00:12:27,523
I'll say it again.

268
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:30,522
You told Brandt on
the phone, he told me.

269
00:12:30,562 --> 00:12:32,481
I know what happened.
Yes? Yes?

270
00:12:32,521 --> 00:12:33,941
Oh, so you know that

271
00:12:33,981 --> 00:12:36,030
They were trying
to piss on your rug?

272
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,989
Did I urinate
on your rug?

273
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:40,029
You mean, did you
personally come

274
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:41,448
and pee on my rug?

275
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,028
Hello! Do you
speak English, son?

276
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,527
Parla usted ingles?

277
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:47,986
I'll ask you again.
Did I urinate on your rug?

278
00:12:48,076 --> 00:12:51,075
No, like I said,
Woo peed on my rug.

279
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:52,904
I just want to
understand this, sir.

280
00:12:52,994 --> 00:12:55,413
Every time a rug
is micturated upon

281
00:12:55,453 --> 00:12:58,412
In this fair city, I have
to compensate the person

282
00:12:58,492 --> 00:12:59,912
Come on, man,

283
00:12:59,952 --> 00:13:01,991
I'm not trying
to scam anybody here.

284
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,951
..you know,
I.. was just

285
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,000
You were just
looking for a handout

286
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,959
like every other...

287
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:10,958
Are you employed,
Mr. Lebowski?

288
00:13:11,038 --> 00:13:12,548
Uh, wait, let me

289
00:13:12,548 --> 00:13:14,507
let me explain
something to you.

290
00:13:14,507 --> 00:13:18,086
I am not Mr. Lebowski.
You're Mr. Lebowski.

291
00:13:18,086 --> 00:13:20,505
I'm The Dude. So that's
what you call me,

292
00:13:20,585 --> 00:13:23,924
You know, that
or, his Dudeness,

293
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:27,013
Or, Duder, or, you
know, el Duderino,

294
00:13:27,013 --> 00:13:29,882
If you're not into
the whole brevity thing.

295
00:13:29,972 --> 00:13:32,971
Are you employed, sir?

296
00:13:32,971 --> 00:13:34,510
Employed?

297
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,509
You don't go out
looking for a job

298
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:40,019
dressed like that,
do you, on a weekday?

299
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:43,018
Is this a..
what day is this?

300
00:13:43,098 --> 00:13:45,057
Well, I do work, sir.

301
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,596
So if you don't mind

302
00:13:46,686 --> 00:13:47,936
No, I do mind.

303
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:49,565
Uh, The Dude minds.

304
00:13:49,565 --> 00:13:51,435
This will not stand,
you know.

305
00:13:51,475 --> 00:13:53,434
This aggression
will not stand, man.

306
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:55,483
I mean, your wife owes

307
00:13:55,483 --> 00:13:58,482
My wife is not
the issue here!

308
00:13:58,482 --> 00:14:00,442
I hope that
someday my wife

309
00:14:00,522 --> 00:14:02,521
will learn to live
on her allowance,

310
00:14:02,611 --> 00:14:04,530
which is ample,
but if she does not,

311
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,530
that is her problem,
not mine,

312
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,069
just as the rug
is your problem,

313
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:10,528
just as every bum's
lot in life

314
00:14:10,568 --> 00:14:12,068
is his own
responsibility,

315
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:14,527
regardless of who
he chooses to blame.

316
00:14:14,577 --> 00:14:18,446
I didn't blame anyone
for the loss of my legs.

317
00:14:18,496 --> 00:14:20,495
Some chinaman took them
from me in Korea.

318
00:14:20,535 --> 00:14:22,954
But I went out
and achieved anyway.

319
00:14:24,454 --> 00:14:26,743
I cannot solve
your problems, sir,

320
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,582
only you can.

321
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:32,451
Oh, fuck it.

322
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:34,040
Yes, that's your answer.

323
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,460
That's your answer
to everything.

324
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,039
Tattoo it
on your forehead.

325
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:39,918
Your revolution is
over, Mr. Lebowski!

326
00:14:39,998 --> 00:14:41,548
Condolences!

327
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,007
The bums lost!

328
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:46,416
My advice to you is to do
what your parents did!

329
00:14:46,466 --> 00:14:48,376
Get a job, sir!

330
00:14:48,426 --> 00:14:50,465
The bums will always lose!

331
00:14:50,465 --> 00:14:52,424
Do you hear me,
Lebowski?!

332
00:14:52,464 --> 00:14:55,513
The bums
will always lose!

333
00:14:55,553 --> 00:14:59,012
How was your meeting,
Mr. Lebowski?

334
00:14:59,092 --> 00:15:03,601
Ok. The old man told me to
take any rug in the house.

335
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:05,220
Well, enjoy,

336
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,639
and perhaps we'll see you
again sometime, Dude.

337
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:10,178
Yeah, sure, if I'm
in the neighbourhood,

338
00:15:10,228 --> 00:15:13,597
You know, and ...

339
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:17,146
I need to use the John.

340
00:15:26,103 --> 00:15:27,603
Blow on them.

341
00:15:28,652 --> 00:15:31,901
Go ahead, blow.

342
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:36,240
You want me to blow
on your, toes?

343
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,358
I can't blow that far.

344
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:48,076
Are you sure
he won't mind?

345
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,115
He really doesn't
care about anything.

346
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,034
He's a nihilist.

347
00:15:52,074 --> 00:15:54,034
Oh, and that
must be exhausting.

348
00:15:54,124 --> 00:15:55,623
You're not blowing.

349
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:58,622
Our guest has to be getting
along, Mrs. Lebowski.

350
00:15:58,702 --> 00:16:02,501
Oh, you're Bunny.

351
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:05,750
I'll suck your cock
for $1,000.

352
00:16:09,628 --> 00:16:11,758
Wonderful woman.

353
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,207
We're all... we're all
very fond of her.

354
00:16:13,257 --> 00:16:14,257
Very free-spirited.

355
00:16:14,297 --> 00:16:15,756
Brandt can't watch,
though,

356
00:16:15,756 --> 00:16:17,296
Or he has
to pay 100.

357
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,095
..that's marvellous.

358
00:16:21,844 --> 00:16:26,013
Uh, I'm just gonna
go find a cash machine.

359
00:16:30,391 --> 00:16:31,801
Slamming them
tonight.

360
00:16:31,851 --> 00:16:33,800
You guys are
dead in the water.

361
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,179
All right!
Way to go, Donny!

362
00:16:37,219 --> 00:16:40,768
If you will it,
it is no dream.

363
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:42,727
You're fucking
20 minutes late, man.

364
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:44,187
What the fuck is that?

365
00:16:44,227 --> 00:16:45,227
Theodore Herzl.

366
00:16:46,316 --> 00:16:48,815
The state of Israel.
If you will it, Dude,

367
00:16:48,855 --> 00:16:49,725
It is no dream.

368
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:51,235
What the fuck you
talking about, man?

369
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:53,274
The carrier. What's
in the fucking carrier?

370
00:16:53,314 --> 00:16:54,653
Oh, Cynthia’s dog.

371
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:57,193
I think
it's a Pomeranian.

372
00:16:57,232 --> 00:16:58,772
I can't leave him
home alone

373
00:16:58,862 --> 00:16:59,692
or he eats
the furniture.

374
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:01,231
I'm watching it

375
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,231
while Cynthia
and Marty Ackerman

376
00:17:02,281 --> 00:17:03,151
are in Hawaii.

377
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,740
You brought a fucking
Pomeranian bowling?

378
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,150
What do you mean,
"brought it bowling"?

379
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:07,609
I didn't rent it shoes,

380
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,238
I'm not buying it
a fucking beer,

381
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,198
he's not taking
your fucking turn, Dude.

382
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:13,157
Man, if my
fucking ex-wife

383
00:17:13,197 --> 00:17:14,737
asked me to take care
of her fucking dog

384
00:17:14,787 --> 00:17:16,156
while she and her boyfriend
went to Honolulu,

385
00:17:16,246 --> 00:17:17,746
I'd tell her to
go fuck herself.

386
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,245
Why can't she board it?

387
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:21,324
First of all, Dude,
you don't have an ex.

388
00:17:21,324 --> 00:17:22,824
Secondly, this is
a fucking show dog

389
00:17:22,914 --> 00:17:24,333
with fucking papers.

390
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,833
You can't board it.
It gets upset.

391
00:17:25,913 --> 00:17:26,833
Its hair falls out.

392
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:29,252
The fucking dog
has fucking papers.

393
00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:31,161
Over the line!

394
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,710
I'm sorry, Smokey,
you were over the line.

395
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,750
That's a foul.

396
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,249
Bullshit.
Mark it 8, Dude.

397
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:39,208
Uh, excuse me, mark it
zero. Next frame.

398
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,217
Bullshit, Walter.
Mark it 8, Dude.

399
00:17:42,297 --> 00:17:44,297
Smokey, this is not
'nam, this is bowling.

400
00:17:44,377 --> 00:17:45,216
There are rules.

401
00:17:45,296 --> 00:17:47,136
Hey, Walter, come on,
it's just

402
00:17:47,136 --> 00:17:48,175
Hey, man, it's Smokey.

403
00:17:48,175 --> 00:17:49,635
So his toe slipped
over a little.

404
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,754
You know, it's
just a game, man.

405
00:17:51,754 --> 00:17:53,134
This is a league game.
This determines

406
00:17:53,214 --> 00:17:54,883
who enters
the next round-robin.

407
00:17:54,883 --> 00:17:55,763
Am I wrong?

408
00:17:55,763 --> 00:17:56,843
Yeah,
but I wasn't

409
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:57,722
Am I wrong?

410
00:17:57,802 --> 00:17:59,222
Yeah,
but I wasn't over.

411
00:17:59,302 --> 00:18:00,131
Give me
the marker, Dude.

412
00:18:00,221 --> 00:18:01,721
I'm marking an 8.

413
00:18:01,721 --> 00:18:03,680
Smokey, my friend,

414
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,640
You're entering
a world of pain.

415
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,679
Walter, man.

416
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:08,559
You mark
that frame an 8,

417
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,258
You're entering
a world of pain.

418
00:18:11,728 --> 00:18:13,677
A world of pain.

419
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:15,756
Look, Dude,
this is your partner.

420
00:18:15,856 --> 00:18:18,275
Has the whole world
gone crazy?!

421
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:20,275
Am I the only one
around here

422
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:21,194
who gives a shit
about the rules?!

423
00:18:21,274 --> 00:18:22,694
Mark it zero!

424
00:18:22,764 --> 00:18:24,233
They're calling
the cops, man.

425
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:25,273
Put the piece away.

426
00:18:25,273 --> 00:18:26,313
Mark it zero!

427
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,652
Walter, put
the piece away.

428
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,191
You think I'm
fucking around here?

429
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:31,991
Mark it zero!

430
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:40,738
All right,
it's fucking zero.

431
00:18:40,768 --> 00:18:43,287
You happy,
you crazy fuck?

432
00:18:45,246 --> 00:18:47,326
It's a league game,
Smoke.

433
00:18:49,785 --> 00:18:51,194
You can't do that, man.

434
00:18:51,244 --> 00:18:52,834
These guys, you know,
they're like me.

435
00:18:52,874 --> 00:18:54,323
They're pacifists.

436
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:56,253
Smokey was a
conscientious objector.

437
00:18:56,293 --> 00:18:57,752
You know, Dude,
I, myself,

438
00:18:57,792 --> 00:18:59,781
dabbled in pacifism
at one point,

439
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:00,711
not in 'nam,
of course.

440
00:19:00,711 --> 00:19:04,290
And you know he's got
emotional problems, man.

441
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,209
You mean,
beyond pacifism?

442
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,128
He's fragile,
Very fragile.

443
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:13,577
Huh. I did not know that.

444
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,136
..it's all water
under the bridge,

445
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:19,675
and we do enter
the next round-robin.

446
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:20,714
Am I wrong?

447
00:19:20,714 --> 00:19:22,164
No, you're not wrong.

448
00:19:22,164 --> 00:19:23,094
Am I wrong?

449
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:24,133
You're not wrong,
Walter,

450
00:19:24,173 --> 00:19:25,633
you're just an asshole!

451
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:27,052
Ok, then.

452
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:28,592
We play Quintana
and O’Brien next week.

453
00:19:28,682 --> 00:19:30,681
They should be pushovers.

454
00:19:32,141 --> 00:19:34,140
Man, will you just

455
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,639
Just take it easy,
man.

456
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:38,638
You know, that's your
answer for everything, Dude.

457
00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:39,978
And let me
point out something.

458
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:42,687
Pacifism is not look
at our current situation

459
00:19:42,757 --> 00:19:44,726
with that
camelfucker in Iraq.

460
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,646
Pacifism is not something
to hide behind.

461
00:19:46,646 --> 00:19:49,645
Just take it easy, man.

462
00:19:49,695 --> 00:19:51,024
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

463
00:19:51,094 --> 00:19:53,523
Yeah, waving
the fucking gun around?

464
00:19:53,613 --> 00:19:55,153
Calmer than you are.

465
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,102
Will you
just take it easy?

466
00:19:57,102 --> 00:19:59,741
Calmer than you are.

467
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,609
Dude, this is Smokey.

468
00:20:05,689 --> 00:20:07,119
Look, I don't want to
be a hard-on about this,

469
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,618
and I know it
wasn't your fault,

470
00:20:08,698 --> 00:20:11,078
but I just thought
it was fair to tell you

471
00:20:11,238 --> 00:20:13,117
that Gilbert and I will be
submitting this to the league

472
00:20:13,157 --> 00:20:15,116
and asking them to
set aside the round,

473
00:20:15,116 --> 00:20:17,665
I don't know,
maybe forfeit it to us.

474
00:20:17,665 --> 00:20:21,074
So, like I say, just thought,
you know, fair warning.

475
00:20:21,074 --> 00:20:23,154
Tell Walter. I'm sorry.

476
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:29,042
Mr. Lebowski, this
is Brandt at,

477
00:20:29,122 --> 00:20:31,671
well, at
Mr. Lebowski's office.

478
00:20:31,671 --> 00:20:34,800
Please call us as
soon as it's convenient.

479
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:38,129
Mr. Lebowski,
this is Bill Selliger

480
00:20:38,168 --> 00:20:39,828
of the Southern Cal
Bowling League,

481
00:20:39,878 --> 00:20:41,797
and I just got
an informal report

482
00:20:41,797 --> 00:20:45,346
that a member of your team,
a Walter Sobchak,

483
00:20:45,386 --> 00:20:47,915
drew a firearm
during league play.

484
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,254
If this is true,
of course,

485
00:20:50,304 --> 00:20:51,674
it contravenes a number
of the league's bylaws

486
00:20:51,724 --> 00:20:53,263
and also article 27
of the league

487
00:20:56,682 --> 00:20:59,221
Dude, I... finally got...
I got the,

488
00:20:59,261 --> 00:21:01,311
the venue I wanted.

489
00:21:01,351 --> 00:21:03,260
I'm performing
my dance quintet,

490
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,730
you know, my cycle,

491
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,809
at Crane Jackson's
fountain street theatre

492
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:08,308
on Tuesday night,

493
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:10,228
and, well, I’d
love it if you came

494
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,317
and gave me notes.

495
00:21:12,317 --> 00:21:14,316
I'll be there, man.

496
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,104
tomorrow's
already the 10th.

497
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:22,694
Far out.

498
00:21:24,773 --> 00:21:26,692
Oh. all right, ok.

499
00:21:26,782 --> 00:21:30,351
Just, just slip
the rent under my door.

500
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,520
...serious infraction

501
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,699
and examine your standing.
Thank you.

502
00:21:39,118 --> 00:21:41,157
Mr. Lebowski,
Brandt again.

503
00:21:41,197 --> 00:21:43,996
Please do call us as
soon as you get in,

504
00:21:44,076 --> 00:21:45,576
and I'll
send a limo.

505
00:21:45,576 --> 00:21:47,075
I hope you're not
avoiding this call

506
00:21:47,075 --> 00:21:48,585
because of the rug..

507
00:21:48,665 --> 00:21:51,584
Which, I assure you,
is not a problem.

508
00:21:51,624 --> 00:21:54,123
We need your help,
and ...

509
00:21:54,203 --> 00:21:56,582
Well, we'd very much
like to see you.

510
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:59,171
Thank you.
it's Brandt.

511
00:22:00,071 --> 00:22:02,160
We've had some
terrible news.

512
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,670
Mr. Lebowski's in seclusion
in the west wing.

513
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:18,045
Funny...

514
00:22:19,085 --> 00:22:23,053
I can look back
on a life of achievement,

515
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,543
challenges met,

516
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,012
competitors bested,

517
00:22:27,052 --> 00:22:29,681
obstacles overcome.

518
00:22:31,181 --> 00:22:34,060
I've accomplished more
than most men

519
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,189
and without the use
of my legs.

520
00:22:40,018 --> 00:22:44,486
What makes a man,
Mr. Lebowski?

521
00:22:48,525 --> 00:22:51,024
I..
don't know, sir.

522
00:22:51,024 --> 00:22:55,193
Is it being prepared
to do the right thing?

523
00:22:56,532 --> 00:22:58,491
Whatever the cost?

524
00:22:58,531 --> 00:23:00,991
Isn't that what
makes a man?

525
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:04,699
Sure, that
and a pair of testicles.

526
00:23:04,739 --> 00:23:06,079
You're joking.

527
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,618
But...

528
00:23:09,078 --> 00:23:10,997
Perhaps you're right.

529
00:23:11,037 --> 00:23:14,076
You mind
if I do a "j"?

530
00:23:14,116 --> 00:23:16,575
Bunny...

531
00:23:18,165 --> 00:23:19,624
Excuse me?

532
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:22,623
Bunny Lebowski,

533
00:23:22,623 --> 00:23:25,622
She is the light
of my life.

534
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:29,381
Are you surprised
at my tears, sir?

535
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:32,050
Fuckin' a.

536
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:40,757
Strong men also cry.

537
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:46,096
I received this fax
this morning.

538
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:50,094
As you can see,

539
00:23:50,184 --> 00:23:52,593
it is a ransom note.

540
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:55,143
"We have Bunnie."

541
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:57,642
Written by men who
are unable to achieve

542
00:23:57,642 --> 00:24:00,061
on a level field
of play.

543
00:24:00,181 --> 00:24:01,560
"Gather one million dollars

544
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,439
in unmarked,
non-consecutive twenties."

545
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:06,479
Weaklings.

546
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,688
"Await instructions."

547
00:24:07,768 --> 00:24:08,568
Bums!

548
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:09,478
"No funny stuff."

549
00:24:09,568 --> 00:24:12,567
Bummer.

550
00:24:14,026 --> 00:24:16,026
This is a bummer,
man.

551
00:24:16,105 --> 00:24:18,105
That's, 
that's a bummer.

552
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:22,863
Brandt will fill you in
on the details.

553
00:24:35,989 --> 00:24:37,948
Mr. Lebowski
is prepared to make

554
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:40,997
a generous offer to you
to act as courier

555
00:24:41,037 --> 00:24:42,996
once we get instructions
for the money.

556
00:24:42,996 --> 00:24:44,496
Why me, man?

557
00:24:44,576 --> 00:24:47,545
He believes the culprits
might be the very people

558
00:24:47,585 --> 00:24:50,584
who ...
soiled your rug,

559
00:24:50,584 --> 00:24:52,003
and you're in
a unique position

560
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:54,003
to confirm
or disconfirm

561
00:24:54,003 --> 00:24:55,542
that suspicion.

562
00:24:55,622 --> 00:24:57,582
He thinks the
carpet pissers did this?

563
00:24:57,582 --> 00:25:00,131
Well, Dude,
we just don't know.

564
00:26:36,548 --> 00:26:39,138
Fucking Quintana.

565
00:26:39,218 --> 00:26:42,097
That creep
can roll, man.

566
00:26:42,097 --> 00:26:43,596
Yeah, but he's
a pervert, Dude.

567
00:26:45,176 --> 00:26:49,184
No. He's a sex offender
with a record.

568
00:26:49,224 --> 00:26:50,144
He did 6 months at chino

569
00:26:50,144 --> 00:26:52,013
for exposing himself
to an 8-year-old.

570
00:26:52,053 --> 00:26:54,103
When he
moved to Hollywood,

571
00:26:54,143 --> 00:26:55,062
He had to go
door-to-door

572
00:26:55,142 --> 00:26:57,142
to tell everyone
he was a pederast.

573
00:26:57,272 --> 00:26:59,691
What's
a pederast, Walter?

574
00:26:59,771 --> 00:27:01,600
Shut the fuck up,
Donny.

575
00:27:04,609 --> 00:27:06,149
How much
they give you?

576
00:27:06,189 --> 00:27:08,148
20 grand, man.

577
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:10,237
And, of course, I still
get to keep the rug.

578
00:27:10,237 --> 00:27:11,107
Just for making
the hand-off?

579
00:27:11,147 --> 00:27:14,736
Yeah. They gave,
Dude a beeper.

580
00:27:14,736 --> 00:27:16,655
Now, so whenever
these guys call

581
00:27:16,695 --> 00:27:17,695
What if it's
during a game?

582
00:27:17,735 --> 00:27:20,074
Oh, I told them if it
was during league play...

583
00:27:20,114 --> 00:27:21,533
What's during
league play?

584
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,153
Life does not
stop and start

585
00:27:23,193 --> 00:27:24,113
at your convenience,

586
00:27:24,113 --> 00:27:26,162
you miserable
piece of shit.

587
00:27:26,202 --> 00:27:27,072
I figure...

588
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:28,121
What's wrong
with Walter, Dude?

589
00:27:28,161 --> 00:27:29,571
I figure
it's easy money.

590
00:27:29,621 --> 00:27:30,620
It's all
pretty harmless.

591
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,120
She probably
kidnapped herself.

592
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:34,199
What do you mean, Dude?

593
00:27:34,249 --> 00:27:36,158
Rug pee-ers
did not do this.

594
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:37,618
Look at it.

595
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:39,167
A young trophy wife

596
00:27:39,207 --> 00:27:41,207
marries this guy
for his money.

597
00:27:41,247 --> 00:27:43,626
She figures he isn't
giving her enough.

598
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:45,125
You know, she owes money
all over town.

599
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:48,045
That fuckin'...
Bitch.

600
00:27:48,085 --> 00:27:50,004
It's all goddamn
fake, man.

601
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,623
It's like Lenin said.

602
00:27:51,673 --> 00:27:54,632
You look for the person
who will benefit,

603
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:57,131
and,
you know...

604
00:27:57,171 --> 00:27:58,051
I am the walrus?

605
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,130
You know,
you'll ...

606
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,630
You know what
I'm trying to say.

607
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,670
I am the walrus.

608
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,629
That fuckin' bitch!

609
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:06,588
I am the walrus.

610
00:28:06,638 --> 00:28:08,548
Shut the fuck up,
Donny!

611
00:28:08,638 --> 00:28:12,096
V.I. Lenin. Vladimir
Ilyich Ulyanov!

612
00:28:12,176 --> 00:28:13,136
What the fuck
is he talking about?

613
00:28:13,226 --> 00:28:14,476
Fucking exactly
what happened.

614
00:28:14,556 --> 00:28:16,515
That makes me
fucking sick.

615
00:28:16,555 --> 00:28:17,555
What do you care,
Walter?

616
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:19,554
Those rich fucks.

617
00:28:19,644 --> 00:28:21,603
This whole
fuckin' thing.

618
00:28:21,603 --> 00:28:23,683
I did not watch
my buddies die

619
00:28:23,683 --> 00:28:24,602
facedown in the mud

620
00:28:24,682 --> 00:28:26,232
so that this
fucking strumpet,

621
00:28:26,232 --> 00:28:27,601
This fucking whore

622
00:28:27,691 --> 00:28:30,150
I don't see any connection
to Vietnam, man.

623
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,190
Well, there's
a literal connection.

624
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,149
No, Walter, face it,
there isn't any connection.

625
00:28:33,229 --> 00:28:34,729
Your roll.

626
00:28:34,729 --> 00:28:36,228
Have it your way,
but my point is

627
00:28:36,228 --> 00:28:37,278
Your roll.

628
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:38,188
Your roll.
My point is

629
00:28:38,188 --> 00:28:39,987
Are you ready
to be fucked, man?

630
00:28:40,107 --> 00:28:45,195
I see you roll your way
into the semis.

631
00:28:45,195 --> 00:28:46,575
Dios mio, man.

632
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:50,114
Liam and me, we're
gonna fuck you up.

633
00:28:51,693 --> 00:28:54,112
Well...you know,
that's just like ...

634
00:28:54,112 --> 00:28:56,991
Your opinion, man.

635
00:28:57,071 --> 00:29:00,700
Let me tell you
something, pendejo,

636
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,699
you pull any
crazy shit with us,

637
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:06,158
you flash a piece out
on the lanes,

638
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:08,747
I'll take it away from you
and stick it up your ass

639
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,577
and pull
The fuckin' trigger

640
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,916
till it goes click.

641
00:29:14,126 --> 00:29:15,045
Jesus.

642
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:16,625
You said it, man.

643
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:21,253
Nobody fucks
with the Jesus.

644
00:29:25,712 --> 00:29:28,011
8-year-olds, Dude.

645
00:30:14,026 --> 00:30:16,575
# The man in me will do #

646
00:30:17,534 --> 00:30:20,403
# Nearly any task #

647
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:23,412
# And as for compensation #

648
00:30:23,492 --> 00:30:25,952
# There's little
he will ask #

649
00:30:27,531 --> 00:30:30,830
# Take a woman
like you #

650
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,959
# To get through #

651
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,999
# To the man in me #

652
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:41,336
# The storm clouds
are raging #

653
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:44,875
# All around my door #

654
00:30:44,955 --> 00:30:46,835
# I think to myself #

655
00:30:46,915 --> 00:30:51,333
# I might not take it
anymore #

656
00:30:51,423 --> 00:30:54,462
# Take a woman
like your kind #

657
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:56,341
# To find #

658
00:30:56,341 --> 00:30:59,300
# The man in me #

659
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:06,928
# What a wonderful feeling #

660
00:31:08,887 --> 00:31:14,096
# Just to know
that you are near... #

661
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,359
They called about
80 minutes ago.

662
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:34,319
They want you
to take the money,

663
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,398
drive north on the 405.
They will call you

664
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:38,397
on the portable phone
with instructions

665
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:39,277
in about 40 minutes.

666
00:31:39,317 --> 00:31:41,366
One person only. They
were very clear on that,

667
00:31:41,406 --> 00:31:43,406
Or I'd go with you.
One person only.

668
00:31:43,446 --> 00:31:44,445
What happened to your jaw?

669
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,575
Oh, nothin',
you know.

670
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,454
Here's the money.

671
00:31:50,363 --> 00:31:51,913
And the phone.

672
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:54,912
Please, Dude, follow whatever
instructions they give.

673
00:31:54,952 --> 00:31:55,951
All right.

674
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:58,331
Her life is in your hands.

675
00:31:58,371 --> 00:31:59,370
Oh, man,
don't say that.

676
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,410
Mr. Lebowski asked me
to repeat that.

677
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,459
Her life is in your hands.

678
00:32:02,499 --> 00:32:03,369
Oh, shit, man.

679
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:05,918
Her life is in
your hands, Dude.

680
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:08,377
Report back to us
as soon as it's done.

681
00:32:18,044 --> 00:32:19,384
Where the fuck
are you goin', man?

682
00:32:19,464 --> 00:32:21,003
Take the ringer.
I'll drive.

683
00:32:21,003 --> 00:32:22,962
What? The what?

684
00:32:23,002 --> 00:32:24,422
The ringer.

685
00:32:24,422 --> 00:32:26,471
The ringer,
Dude.

686
00:32:33,969 --> 00:32:36,388
Have they
Called yet? What the

687
00:32:36,468 --> 00:32:37,847
What the hell is this?

688
00:32:37,927 --> 00:32:39,477
My dirty undies,
Dude.

689
00:32:39,477 --> 00:32:40,846
Laundry.
The whites.

690
00:32:40,936 --> 00:32:43,396
Walter, I'm sure
there's a reason

691
00:32:43,476 --> 00:32:44,975
you brought
your dirty undies, man.

692
00:32:44,975 --> 00:32:46,395
That's right, Dude.
The weight.

693
00:32:46,475 --> 00:32:48,434
The ringer
cannot look empty.

694
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:50,353
Walter, what the fuck
are you thinking, man?

695
00:32:50,353 --> 00:32:52,483
You're right, Dude.
I got to thinking.

696
00:32:52,483 --> 00:32:53,812
I got to thinking
why should we settle

697
00:32:53,892 --> 00:32:55,402
for a measly fuckin'
20 grand

698
00:32:55,402 --> 00:32:56,811
We? What the fuck we?

699
00:32:56,901 --> 00:32:58,271
You said you just wanted
to come along.

700
00:32:58,361 --> 00:32:59,320
My point, Dude, is

701
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,820
why should we
settle for 20 grand

702
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,899
when we can keep
the entire million?

703
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:04,858
Am I wrong?
Yes, you're wrong.

704
00:33:04,938 --> 00:33:06,318
This isn't
a fuckin' game, man.

705
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,857
Oh, but it is a game.
You said so yourself.

706
00:33:08,857 --> 00:33:10,487
She kidnapped herself.

707
00:33:10,487 --> 00:33:11,486
I said I thought

708
00:33:17,494 --> 00:33:19,034
Dude here.

709
00:33:19,114 --> 00:33:21,033
Who is this?

710
00:33:21,073 --> 00:33:23,872
Dude the bagman, man.
Where do you want us to go?

711
00:33:23,912 --> 00:33:25,412
Us?

712
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,419
Yeah, you know,
me and the driver.

713
00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:34,958
I'm not handling the money,
driving the car,

714
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:36,418
and talking on the phone
all by my

715
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:37,747
Shut the fuck up!

716
00:33:37,787 --> 00:33:39,377
Dude, are you
fuckin' this up?

717
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:40,916
Who is that?

718
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:43,835
That is the driver.

719
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:46,335
I told you

720
00:33:47,464 --> 00:33:48,464
What the fuck's
goin' on?

721
00:33:48,504 --> 00:33:50,383
Walter! What the fuck
is goin' on?

722
00:33:50,463 --> 00:33:51,303
He hung up, man!

723
00:33:51,343 --> 00:33:54,342
You fucked it up!

724
00:33:54,422 --> 00:33:55,971
Her life was
in our hands, man.

725
00:33:55,971 --> 00:33:56,841
Easy, Dude.

726
00:33:56,881 --> 00:33:58,890
We're screwed now.
We don't get shit.

727
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,970
They're gonna kill her.

728
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:01,889
We're fucked, Walter.

729
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:03,639
Nothing is fucked,
Dude.

730
00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:06,098
Come on, you're
being very un-Dude.

731
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:07,557
They'll call back.

732
00:34:07,597 --> 00:34:09,227
Look,
she kidnapped

733
00:34:10,137 --> 00:34:12,056
You see? Nothing's
fucked here, Dude.

734
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,645
Nothing is fucked.

735
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:15,605
They're a bunch of
fuckin' amateurs!

736
00:34:15,645 --> 00:34:18,564
Hey, Walter, will you
just shut the fuck up?

737
00:34:18,604 --> 00:34:21,023
Don't say peep while I'm
doin' business here, man.

738
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:23,102
Ok, Dude,
have it your way.

739
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:26,521
But they're amateurs.

740
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,569
Ok, we proceed.

741
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,529
But only if there's
no funny stuff.

742
00:34:35,108 --> 00:34:36,608
So no funny stuff, ok?

743
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:40,196
Just tell me where the fuck
you want us to go.

744
00:34:43,905 --> 00:34:45,245
That was the sign, man.

745
00:34:45,285 --> 00:34:49,413
So all we gotta do
is get her back,

746
00:34:49,613 --> 00:34:51,573
No one's in a position
to complain,

747
00:34:51,663 --> 00:34:53,662
And we keep
the baksheesh.

748
00:34:53,742 --> 00:34:54,582
Yeah, terrific, Walter,

749
00:34:54,662 --> 00:34:56,661
but you haven't told me how
we're gonna get her back.

750
00:34:56,751 --> 00:34:57,661
Where is she?

751
00:34:57,661 --> 00:34:59,160
That's the simple part,
Dude.

752
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:00,620
We make the hand-off,

753
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,169
I grab one of 'em,
beat it out of him.

754
00:35:04,788 --> 00:35:06,168
Yeah. That's
a great plan.

755
00:35:06,248 --> 00:35:08,707
Walter, that's
fucking ingenious,

756
00:35:08,837 --> 00:35:10,166
If I understand it
correctly.

757
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:11,666
It's a Swiss
fuckin' watch.

758
00:35:11,756 --> 00:35:12,586
That's right, Dude.

759
00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:14,625
The beauty of this
is its simplicity.

760
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:16,584
Once a plan
gets too complex,

761
00:35:16,584 --> 00:35:18,094
everything
can go wrong.

762
00:35:18,094 --> 00:35:20,173
If there's one thing I
learned in 'nam, it's

763
00:35:25,221 --> 00:35:27,091
You're coming
to a wooden bridge.

764
00:35:27,181 --> 00:35:28,550
When you cross
the bridge,

765
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,600
you throw the bag

766
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,639
from the left window
of the moving car.

767
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:33,139
You're being watched.

768
00:35:35,178 --> 00:35:36,598
What'd he say?
Where's the hand-off?

769
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:38,187
There is no fuckin'
hand-off, man.

770
00:35:38,187 --> 00:35:40,086
At the wooden bridge, we throw
the money out of the car.

771
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,145
We throw the money
out of the moving car.

772
00:35:43,215 --> 00:35:45,645
No, we can't
do that, Dude.

773
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,564
That fucks up
our plan.

774
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:49,643
Well, call 'em up and
explain it to them, Walter.

775
00:35:49,693 --> 00:35:51,143
Your plan
is so fuckin' simple

776
00:35:51,193 --> 00:35:52,692
I'm sure they'll
fuckin' understand it.

777
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,182
That's the beauty of it.

778
00:35:54,272 --> 00:35:55,111
Wooden bridge, huh?

779
00:35:55,151 --> 00:35:56,151
I'm throwin' the money,
Walter.

780
00:35:56,191 --> 00:35:57,691
We're not fuckin'
around, man.

781
00:35:57,691 --> 00:35:59,190
Ok, Dude,
bridge is comin' up.

782
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,110
Give me the ringer,
chop-chop.

783
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,689
Fuck that, Walter.
I love ya,

784
00:36:01,779 --> 00:36:04,238
but sooner or later you're
gonna have to face the fact

785
00:36:04,278 --> 00:36:05,278
you're a goddamn moron.

786
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:06,688
Ok, Dude.
No time to argue.

787
00:36:06,777 --> 00:36:07,657
Hey, man.
The bridge.

788
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:12,196
There goes the ringer!

789
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:14,655
What the fuck?!

790
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:16,064
Here, Dude, your wheel.

791
00:36:16,114 --> 00:36:18,454
At 15 mph, I roll out.

792
00:36:18,534 --> 00:36:20,163
I double back, grab one,
and beat it out of him.

793
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:21,583
The Uzi.
Uzi?!

794
00:36:21,662 --> 00:36:23,622
You didn't think I was
rolling out of here naked?

795
00:36:23,662 --> 00:36:24,661
Walter, please..

796
00:36:24,701 --> 00:36:26,621
15, Dude. This is it.
Let's take that hill!

797
00:36:47,214 --> 00:36:55,551
We have it!

798
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:58,180
We...have it!

799
00:37:12,226 --> 00:37:14,065
Aw, fuck it, Dude.

800
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,644
Let's go bowling.

801
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:55,751
Etz chaim he, Dude,

802
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:57,700
as the ex used to say.

803
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,630
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

804
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,589
What the fuck are we
gonna tell Lebowski?

805
00:38:06,207 --> 00:38:08,167
Well, what exactly
is the problem?

806
00:38:08,167 --> 00:38:10,256
The problem is

807
00:38:11,126 --> 00:38:12,175
What do you mean,
What's the

808
00:38:13,175 --> 00:38:14,545
There was no...

809
00:38:14,595 --> 00:38:17,254
We... didn't...

810
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:20,623
They're gonna kill
that poor woman, man.

811
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,052
What the fuck are you
talking about?

812
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:23,092
The poor woman

813
00:38:23,212 --> 00:38:24,141
that poor slut

814
00:38:24,251 --> 00:38:25,091
kidnapped herself.

815
00:38:25,141 --> 00:38:26,721
Come on, Dude,
you said so yourself.

816
00:38:26,761 --> 00:38:28,720
Man, I said I thought
she kidnapped herself.

817
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,139
You're the one who's
so fuckin' certain.

818
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:31,679
That's right, Dude.

819
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:33,268
100% certain.

820
00:38:33,308 --> 00:38:34,808
They posted the next round
for the tournament.

821
00:38:34,808 --> 00:38:37,297
Donny, shut the fuck
when do we play?

822
00:38:37,347 --> 00:38:38,097
This Saturday.

823
00:38:38,147 --> 00:38:40,186
Saturday? Well, they
have to reschedule.

824
00:38:40,226 --> 00:38:42,725
Walter, what am I
gonna tell Lebowski?

825
00:38:42,775 --> 00:38:45,234
I told that fuck down
at the league office

826
00:38:45,234 --> 00:38:46,734
Who's in charge 
of scheduling?

827
00:38:47,814 --> 00:38:49,693
I told that kraut
a fuckin' thousand times

828
00:38:49,693 --> 00:38:50,903
I don't roll
on Shabbos.

829
00:38:50,942 --> 00:38:52,272
He already Walter
posted it.

830
00:38:52,312 --> 00:38:53,862
Well, he can fuckin'
unpost it!

831
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:55,361
Who gives a shit?!

832
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:57,190
They're gonna kill
that poor woman, man.

833
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,780
What am I gonna tell
Lebowski?

834
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,229
..eventually she'll get tired
of her little game

835
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:02,699
and, you know,
wander on back.

836
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:04,278
How come you don't roll
on Saturday, Walter?

837
00:39:04,278 --> 00:39:05,238
I'm Shomer Shabbos.

838
00:39:05,278 --> 00:39:06,277
What's that, Walter?

839
00:39:06,327 --> 00:39:07,197
Yeah,
and in the meantime,

840
00:39:07,287 --> 00:39:08,787
What do I tell
Lebowski?

841
00:39:08,787 --> 00:39:10,286
Saturday, Donny,
is Shabbos,

842
00:39:10,286 --> 00:39:12,245
The Jewish day of rest.
That means I don't work,

843
00:39:12,245 --> 00:39:15,204
I don't drive a car,
I don't fuckin' ride in a car,

844
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:17,284
I don't handle money,
I don't turn on the oven,

845
00:39:17,404 --> 00:39:19,833
and I sure as shit
don't fucking roll!

846
00:39:21,332 --> 00:39:23,292
Shomer Shabbos!

847
00:39:26,171 --> 00:39:27,710
Shomer fucking Shabbos.

848
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,710
Oh, fuck! That's it!
I'm outta here.

849
00:39:29,789 --> 00:39:31,289
Oh, come on, Dude.

850
00:39:35,298 --> 00:39:38,297
Look, you just tell him

851
00:39:38,297 --> 00:39:39,676
Tell him we made the drop,

852
00:39:39,786 --> 00:39:41,176
and everything went,
you know...

853
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:42,295
Oh, yeah,
how'd it go?

854
00:39:42,295 --> 00:39:44,175
Went all right. Dude's car
got a little dinged up.

855
00:39:44,255 --> 00:39:46,714
Walter, we didn't make
the fuckin' hand-off, man.

856
00:39:46,804 --> 00:39:48,803
They didn't get
the fuckin' money!

857
00:39:48,883 --> 00:39:50,213
And they're gonna..

858
00:39:50,253 --> 00:39:51,842
They're gonna kill
that poor woman.

859
00:39:51,882 --> 00:39:54,601
They're gonna kill
that poor woman

860
00:39:54,681 --> 00:39:56,221
Hey, Walter, if you
can't ride in a car,

861
00:39:56,221 --> 00:39:57,680
how do you get around
on shammos?

862
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,220
Really, Dude,
you surprise me.

863
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:02,219
They're not gonna kill shit,
they're not gonna do shit.

864
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:03,188
What can they do to her?

865
00:40:03,188 --> 00:40:04,228
They're a bunch
of fuckin' amateurs,

866
00:40:04,228 --> 00:40:05,687
And meanwhile,
look at the bottom line.

867
00:40:05,727 --> 00:40:07,767
Who's sittin' on
a million fucking dollars?

868
00:40:09,356 --> 00:40:11,316
Who's got a fuckin' million
fuckin' dollars

869
00:40:11,396 --> 00:40:12,725
sitting in the trunk
of our car?

870
00:40:12,775 --> 00:40:13,775
Our car, Walter?

871
00:40:13,815 --> 00:40:15,764
And what do they got?
My dirty undies.

872
00:40:15,854 --> 00:40:17,773
My fuckin' whites.

873
00:40:23,362 --> 00:40:25,231
Say, Dude.

874
00:40:25,281 --> 00:40:26,780
Where is your car?

875
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,200
Who's got your
undies, Walter?

876
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,239
Where's your car, Dude?

877
00:40:30,279 --> 00:40:32,818
You don't know,
Walter?

878
00:40:33,868 --> 00:40:35,827
It was parked
in a handicap zone.

879
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:36,787
Perhaps they towed it.

880
00:40:38,367 --> 00:40:40,776
You fuckin' know
it's been stolen.

881
00:40:40,826 --> 00:40:43,905
Well, certainly that's
a possibility, Dude.

882
00:40:45,284 --> 00:40:46,284
Oh, fuck it.

883
00:40:49,243 --> 00:40:50,692
Where you goin', Dude?

884
00:40:50,792 --> 00:40:52,242
I'm goin' home, Donny.

885
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:54,211
Phone's ringing, Dude.

886
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:56,330
Thank you, Donny.

887
00:41:13,085 --> 00:41:15,054
Green.

888
00:41:15,094 --> 00:41:18,013
Some, brown or...

889
00:41:18,013 --> 00:41:20,552
Rust coloration.

890
00:41:20,552 --> 00:41:23,551
And was there anything
of value in the car?

891
00:41:24,971 --> 00:41:28,020
...a tape deck,

892
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,519
some Creedence tapes,

893
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:32,518
and there was a...

894
00:41:32,518 --> 00:41:35,647
my briefcase.

895
00:41:37,397 --> 00:41:39,476
In the briefcase?

896
00:41:40,526 --> 00:41:42,485
..papers.

897
00:41:42,565 --> 00:41:44,564
You know
just papers.

898
00:41:44,644 --> 00:41:47,863
You know,
my papers.

899
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:49,443
Business papers.

900
00:41:50,982 --> 00:41:52,942
And what do you do,
Sir?

901
00:41:52,942 --> 00:41:54,531
I'm unemployed.

902
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,659
My rug was
also stolen.

903
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:02,568
Your rug was in the car?

904
00:42:02,608 --> 00:42:03,608
No, here.

905
00:42:05,687 --> 00:42:07,117
Separate incidents?

906
00:42:10,666 --> 00:42:14,494
Do you find them much,
these stolen cars?

907
00:42:14,494 --> 00:42:16,993
Sometimes.

908
00:42:17,043 --> 00:42:19,083
Wouldn't hold out much hope
for the tape deck, though.

909
00:42:19,123 --> 00:42:21,082
Or the Creedence.

910
00:42:21,082 --> 00:42:24,081
Well, what about...

911
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:25,920
The briefcase?

912
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,420
Mr. Lebowski,
I'd like to see you.

913
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,549
Call when you get home,
and I'll send a car for you.

914
00:42:29,549 --> 00:42:30,419
My name is Maude Lebowski.

915
00:42:30,459 --> 00:42:32,968
I'm the one
who took your rug.

916
00:42:34,048 --> 00:42:38,216
Guess we can close
the file on that one.

917
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:27,700
El Franco,
ay` dame abajo.

918
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,369
I'll be with you
in a moment, Mr. Lebowski.

919
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:52,581
Does the female form make you
uncomfortable, Mr. Lebowski?

920
00:43:52,581 --> 00:43:55,161
..is that what this
is a picture of?

921
00:43:55,251 --> 00:43:56,750
In a sense, yes.

922
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,629
My art has been commended
as being strongly vaginal,

923
00:43:59,709 --> 00:44:00,669
which bothers some men.

924
00:44:00,759 --> 00:44:03,678
The word itself makes
some men uncomfortable.

925
00:44:03,758 --> 00:44:05,037
Vagina.

926
00:44:05,087 --> 00:44:06,577
Oh, yeah?

927
00:44:06,627 --> 00:44:08,546
Yes, they don't like hearing it
and find it difficult to say,

928
00:44:08,666 --> 00:44:10,056
whereas without
batting an eye,

929
00:44:10,136 --> 00:44:12,135
a man will refer to
his dick or his rod

930
00:44:12,215 --> 00:44:14,674
Or his... Johnson.

931
00:44:15,684 --> 00:44:16,633
Johnson?

932
00:44:16,723 --> 00:44:18,043
All right, Mr. Lebowski.

933
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:19,682
Let's get down to cases.

934
00:44:19,722 --> 00:44:22,102
My father told me he agreed
to let you have the rug,

935
00:44:22,212 --> 00:44:24,641
but as it was a gift
from me to my late mother,

936
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:25,680
it was not his to give.

937
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,099
Your face.

938
00:44:29,139 --> 00:44:31,089
As for this kidnapping...

939
00:44:32,728 --> 00:44:34,018
Yes, I know all about it,

940
00:44:34,058 --> 00:44:35,607
And I know that
you acted as courier.

941
00:44:35,647 --> 00:44:37,067
Let me tell you something.

942
00:44:37,147 --> 00:44:38,646
The whole thing stinks
to high heaven.

943
00:44:40,146 --> 00:44:42,105
Right, but let me
explain something

944
00:44:42,105 --> 00:44:43,594
About the rug.

945
00:44:43,694 --> 00:44:46,064
Do you like sex,
Mr. Lebowski?

946
00:44:46,114 --> 00:44:47,113
Excuse me?

947
00:44:47,113 --> 00:44:49,532
Sex. The physical act
of love. Coitus.

948
00:44:49,572 --> 00:44:51,152
Do you like it?

949
00:44:51,192 --> 00:44:53,111
I was talking
about my rug.

950
00:44:53,151 --> 00:44:55,061
You're not interested
in sex?

951
00:44:55,111 --> 00:44:56,650
You mean coitus?

952
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,530
I like it, too.

953
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,619
It's a male myth
about feminists

954
00:44:59,659 --> 00:45:00,579
That we hate sex.

955
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:03,038
It can be a natural,
zesty enterprise.

956
00:45:03,078 --> 00:45:04,577
However, there
are some people

957
00:45:04,617 --> 00:45:07,566
It is called satyriasis in men,
nymphomania in women

958
00:45:07,616 --> 00:45:10,535
who engage in it compulsively
and without joy.

959
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,544
Oh, yes, Mr. Lebowski.

960
00:45:13,584 --> 00:45:16,163
These unfortunate souls
cannot love

961
00:45:16,203 --> 00:45:17,713
in the true sense
of the word.

962
00:45:17,753 --> 00:45:21,112
Our mutual acquaintance
Bunny is one of these.

963
00:45:21,172 --> 00:45:22,751
Listen, Maude,

964
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:26,670
um, I'm sorry if your
stepmother is a nympho,

965
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:28,259
but, you know,

966
00:45:28,299 --> 00:45:30,669
I don't see what this
has to do with...

967
00:45:30,669 --> 00:45:32,038
Do you have any Kahlua?

968
00:45:32,128 --> 00:45:34,047
Take' a look
at this, sir.

969
00:45:36,137 --> 00:45:38,716
Oh, I know that guy.

970
00:45:40,175 --> 00:45:42,725
He's a nihilist.

971
00:46:00,189 --> 00:46:02,108
Hello. Meine dispatcher says

972
00:46:02,108 --> 00:46:04,067
there's something wrong
mitt deine kable.

973
00:46:04,147 --> 00:46:06,027
Yeah, come on in.
I'm not really sure

974
00:46:06,107 --> 00:46:08,106
exactly what's really
wrong with the cable.

975
00:46:08,186 --> 00:46:10,145
Zat's why they sent me.
I am an expert.

976
00:46:10,145 --> 00:46:11,565
The TV's in here.

977
00:46:11,655 --> 00:46:13,734
You recognize her,
of course.

978
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:19,612
Oh, that's
my friend Shari.

979
00:46:19,692 --> 00:46:21,612
She just came over
to use the shower.

980
00:46:21,652 --> 00:46:23,701
The story
is ludicrous.

981
00:46:23,741 --> 00:46:27,120
Meine nommen is Karl.
Ich bin expert.

982
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,619
You must be here
to fix the cable.

983
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:32,118
Lord, you can imagine
where it goes from here.

984
00:46:32,198 --> 00:46:33,578
He fixes the cable?

985
00:46:33,578 --> 00:46:35,077
Don't be fatuous,
Jeffrey.

986
00:46:35,077 --> 00:46:37,536
Little matter to me
that this woman chose

987
00:46:37,576 --> 00:46:39,076
to pursue a career
in pornography

988
00:46:39,126 --> 00:46:41,625
nor that she has been
"banging" Jackie Treehorn,

989
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:43,544
to use the parlance
of our times,

990
00:46:43,584 --> 00:46:45,164
however,

991
00:46:45,204 --> 00:46:48,043
I am one of the 2 trustees
of the Lebowski Foundation,

992
00:46:48,083 --> 00:46:49,622
the other being my father.

993
00:46:49,672 --> 00:46:51,582
The Foundation takes
youngsters from watts and

994
00:46:51,631 --> 00:46:53,041
Shit, yeah,
the achievers.

995
00:46:53,131 --> 00:46:54,591
Little Lebowski
urban achievers, yes,

996
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,630
and proud we are
of all of them,

997
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:59,629
I asked my father about
his withdrawal of $1 million

998
00:46:59,669 --> 00:47:00,678
from the Foundation account,

999
00:47:00,718 --> 00:47:02,638
and he told me
about this abduction.

1000
00:47:02,678 --> 00:47:04,087
But I tell you,
it is preposterous.

1001
00:47:04,137 --> 00:47:05,717
This compulsive fornicator

1002
00:47:05,757 --> 00:47:08,136
is taking my father
for the proverbial ride.

1003
00:47:08,176 --> 00:47:09,136
Yeah, but my

1004
00:47:09,176 --> 00:47:10,175
I'm getting to your rug.

1005
00:47:10,215 --> 00:47:12,135
My father and I
don't get along.

1006
00:47:12,175 --> 00:47:13,684
He doesn't approve
of my lifestyle,

1007
00:47:13,724 --> 00:47:15,723
and, needless to say,
I don't approve of his.

1008
00:47:15,763 --> 00:47:18,722
However, I hardly wish to make
my father's embezzlement

1009
00:47:18,762 --> 00:47:19,642
a police matter,

1010
00:47:19,682 --> 00:47:22,561
so I'm proposing that you
try to recover the money

1011
00:47:22,641 --> 00:47:24,101
from the people
you delivered it to.

1012
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:27,519
Well, 
I could do that.

1013
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:30,648
If you successfully do so,
I will compensate you

1014
00:47:30,688 --> 00:47:35,277
to the tune of 10%
of the recovered sum.

1015
00:47:35,277 --> 00:47:36,187
A hundred...

1016
00:47:36,277 --> 00:47:38,696
Thousand. Yes.
Bones or clams

1017
00:47:38,736 --> 00:47:39,735
or whatever you call them.

1018
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:42,275
Yeah, but...

1019
00:47:42,275 --> 00:47:43,734
What about my...

1020
00:47:43,774 --> 00:47:45,823
Your rug, yes.
well, with that money

1021
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,233
you can buy
any number of rugs

1022
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:49,152
That don't have
sentimental value for me.

1023
00:47:49,152 --> 00:47:52,161
And I am sorry about
that crack on the jaw.

1024
00:47:52,241 --> 00:47:55,120
Oh, th-that's fine.
That doesn't even...

1025
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,200
Here's the name and number
of a doctor

1026
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,239
who will look at it
for you.

1027
00:47:58,239 --> 00:47:59,119
You will receive no bill.

1028
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:00,658
He's a good man,
and thorough.

1029
00:48:00,748 --> 00:48:03,158
Th-that's thoughtful,
But

1030
00:48:03,248 --> 00:48:04,207
Please see him, Jeffrey.

1031
00:48:04,287 --> 00:48:06,247
He's a good man,
and thorough.

1032
00:48:06,247 --> 00:48:08,206
Oh, well...

1033
00:48:08,206 --> 00:48:09,835
All right.
All right.

1034
00:48:11,295 --> 00:48:12,704
So he says, "My wife's
a pain in the ass.

1035
00:48:12,704 --> 00:48:14,794
She's always bustin'
my friggin' agates.

1036
00:48:14,794 --> 00:48:18,083
My daughter's married
to a real loser bastard,

1037
00:48:18,173 --> 00:48:20,632
and I got a rash
so bad on my ass

1038
00:48:20,632 --> 00:48:22,131
I can't even sit down.

1039
00:48:22,211 --> 00:48:25,210
But you know me, I can't
complain."

1040
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:27,130
Ah, fuckin' a, man.
I got a rash, man.

1041
00:48:27,169 --> 00:48:29,259
Fuckin' a.

1042
00:48:30,258 --> 00:48:33,257
I gotta tell you,
Tone, man,

1043
00:48:33,257 --> 00:48:35,757
Earlier in the day, I was
really feeling shitty, man.

1044
00:48:35,807 --> 00:48:37,766
Really down
in the dumps.

1045
00:48:37,846 --> 00:48:39,265
Lost a little money...

1046
00:48:39,345 --> 00:48:42,304
Hey, you know what?
forget about it, huh?

1047
00:48:42,344 --> 00:48:43,304
Forget about it.

1048
00:48:43,394 --> 00:48:44,684
Yeah, fuck it, man.

1049
00:48:44,724 --> 00:48:46,143
I can't be worried
about that shit.

1050
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:47,103
Life goes on, man.

1051
00:48:47,143 --> 00:48:49,682
Home, sweet home,
Mr. L.

1052
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,650
Who's your friend
in the Volkswagen?

1053
00:48:58,729 --> 00:49:01,228
Yeah, he followed us
here.

1054
00:49:01,268 --> 00:49:03,187
When did he start foll...

1055
00:49:03,227 --> 00:49:04,237
What the fuck?!

1056
00:49:04,277 --> 00:49:06,816
In the limo, you son
of a bitch. No arguing.

1057
00:49:06,816 --> 00:49:09,275
Hey, careful, man.
there's a beverage here.

1058
00:49:10,815 --> 00:49:12,614
Start talking

1059
00:49:12,654 --> 00:49:13,654
and talk fast,
you lousy bum.

1060
00:49:13,694 --> 00:49:15,613
We've been frantically
trying to reach you, Dude.

1061
00:49:15,653 --> 00:49:18,782
Where's my goddamn
money, you bum?!

1062
00:49:19,782 --> 00:49:21,111
Well, we...

1063
00:49:22,241 --> 00:49:23,201
They did not

1064
00:49:23,281 --> 00:49:25,240
receive the money,
you nitwit!

1065
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,620
They did not receive
the money!

1066
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,159
Her life
was in your hands!

1067
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:30,748
This is our concern,
Dude.

1068
00:49:30,788 --> 00:49:33,287
No, man,
nothing is fucked here.

1069
00:49:33,327 --> 00:49:34,207
Nothing is fucked?!

1070
00:49:35,287 --> 00:49:36,286
The goddamn plane

1071
00:49:36,326 --> 00:49:38,796
Has crashed
into the mountain!

1072
00:49:38,835 --> 00:49:39,705
Look, man, come on.

1073
00:49:39,705 --> 00:49:43,164
Who are you gonna believe,
those guys or...

1074
00:49:43,164 --> 00:49:45,123
We dropped off
the damn money.

1075
00:49:45,173 --> 00:49:47,043
We?!

1076
00:49:48,672 --> 00:49:50,132
The royal we.

1077
00:49:50,132 --> 00:49:51,671
You know, the editorial.

1078
00:49:51,751 --> 00:49:54,170
I dropped off the money
exactly as per

1079
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:57,629
Look. Man, I've got certain
information, all right?

1080
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:00,638
Certain things have
come to light, and...

1081
00:50:00,718 --> 00:50:03,137
You know, has it
ever occurred to you

1082
00:50:03,217 --> 00:50:07,176
that instead of,
you know, running around,

1083
00:50:07,266 --> 00:50:11,055
blaming me, given the
nature of all this new shit,

1084
00:50:11,135 --> 00:50:14,184
this could be
a lot more, ...

1085
00:50:14,264 --> 00:50:17,183
.. complex?

1086
00:50:17,263 --> 00:50:20,771
I mean, it might not be
just such a simple,

1087
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:21,641
You know?

1088
00:50:21,771 --> 00:50:23,271
What in God's
holy name

1089
00:50:23,271 --> 00:50:25,190
Are you blathering
about?

1090
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:28,229
Well, I'll tell you what
I'm blathering about.

1091
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:29,688
I've got information, man.

1092
00:50:29,768 --> 00:50:31,728
New shit has come to light.

1093
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:34,277
And ... shit, man...

1094
00:50:35,776 --> 00:50:38,316
She kidnapped herself.

1095
00:50:39,655 --> 00:50:42,234
Well, sure, man.

1096
00:50:42,324 --> 00:50:45,193
Look at it. You know,
a young trophy wife

1097
00:50:45,193 --> 00:50:47,283
In the parlance
of our times, you know

1098
00:50:47,283 --> 00:50:50,701
She .. owes
money all over town,

1099
00:50:50,701 --> 00:50:52,741
Including to known
pornographers.

1100
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,249
And that's cool.
that-that's cool.

1101
00:50:57,249 --> 00:51:01,208
I'm saying,
she needs money, man.

1102
00:51:01,248 --> 00:51:02,747
And... you know,

1103
00:51:02,787 --> 00:51:05,127
of course they're gonna say
they didn't get it,

1104
00:51:05,167 --> 00:51:09,125
because
she wants more, man.

1105
00:51:09,165 --> 00:51:12,794
She's gotta feed the monkey.
I mean...

1106
00:51:14,124 --> 00:51:17,173
Hasn't that ever occurred
to you, man?

1107
00:51:20,671 --> 00:51:22,131
No, Mr. Lebowski,

1108
00:51:22,171 --> 00:51:24,220
it had not occurred
to me.

1109
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,260
That had not occurred
to us, Dude.

1110
00:51:26,299 --> 00:51:28,219
Well, ok, you know,

1111
00:51:28,259 --> 00:51:30,758
you guys aren't privy
to all the new shit, so...

1112
00:51:30,798 --> 00:51:33,597
..you know. But...

1113
00:51:33,637 --> 00:51:37,346
..that's what you
that's what you pay me for.

1114
00:51:38,685 --> 00:51:41,644
Speaking of which,
do you think that you could,

1115
00:51:41,644 --> 00:51:44,184
give me my 20,000 in cash?

1116
00:51:44,223 --> 00:51:47,143
My concern is... and I gotta
check with my accountant

1117
00:51:47,143 --> 00:51:49,682
but this might bump me
into a higher tax,

1118
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:50,731
Brandt...

1119
00:51:50,771 --> 00:51:52,691
Give him
the envelope.

1120
00:51:52,731 --> 00:51:56,229
Oh, well, if you've already
got the check made out,

1121
00:51:56,229 --> 00:51:57,319
Th-that's cool.

1122
00:51:57,439 --> 00:51:59,938
We received this
this morning.

1123
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:04,777
Since you have
failed to achieve,

1124
00:52:04,817 --> 00:52:08,315
even in the modest task
which was your charge,

1125
00:52:08,315 --> 00:52:12,234
since you have
stolen my money,

1126
00:52:12,324 --> 00:52:15,823
since you have unrepentantly
betrayed my trust...

1127
00:52:15,903 --> 00:52:17,282
I have no choice

1128
00:52:17,282 --> 00:52:22,371
but to tell these bums to do
whatever is necessary

1129
00:52:22,451 --> 00:52:26,369
to recover their money
from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.

1130
00:52:26,369 --> 00:52:29,248
And with Brandt
as my witness,

1131
00:52:29,328 --> 00:52:30,708
I will tell you this:

1132
00:52:30,788 --> 00:52:34,747
Any further harm
visited upon Bunny

1133
00:52:34,837 --> 00:52:39,755
will be visited tenfold
upon your head.

1134
00:52:41,294 --> 00:52:46,793
By god, sir, I will not
abide another toe.

1135
00:52:52,471 --> 00:52:55,929
That wasn't her toe, Dude.

1136
00:52:56,009 --> 00:52:57,719
Whose toe was it,
Walter?

1137
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:58,759
How the fuck should I know?

1138
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:01,218
I do know that nothing
about it indicates

1139
00:53:01,258 --> 00:53:02,767
Man, the nail
polish, Walter.

1140
00:53:02,767 --> 00:53:04,267
Fine, Dude.

1141
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,266
As if it's impossible
to get some nail polish,

1142
00:53:06,306 --> 00:53:07,726
Apply it
To someone else's toe.

1143
00:53:07,806 --> 00:53:09,305
Someone else's

1144
00:53:09,305 --> 00:53:11,224
Where the fuck
are they gonna get

1145
00:53:11,264 --> 00:53:13,224
You want a toe?
I can get you a toe.

1146
00:53:13,314 --> 00:53:15,683
Believe me,
there are ways, Dude.

1147
00:53:15,773 --> 00:53:17,732
You don't wanna know
about it, believe me.

1148
00:53:17,812 --> 00:53:19,851
Hell, I can get you a toe
by 3:00 this afternoon,

1149
00:53:19,891 --> 00:53:20,731
with nail polish.

1150
00:53:20,771 --> 00:53:22,810
These fuckin' amateurs.

1151
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,360
They send us a toe,

1152
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,779
we're supposed to shit
ourselves with fear.

1153
00:53:27,899 --> 00:53:28,778
Now, the point is

1154
00:53:28,818 --> 00:53:30,318
They're gonna kill her,
Walter,

1155
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:32,357
And then they're gonna
kill me.

1156
00:53:32,397 --> 00:53:34,317
Dude...

1157
00:53:34,357 --> 00:53:35,816
That's...

1158
00:53:35,866 --> 00:53:37,865
That's just the stress
talking, man.

1159
00:53:37,905 --> 00:53:40,864
Now so far we have
what appears to me

1160
00:53:40,904 --> 00:53:43,404
To be a series of
victimless crimes.

1161
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:44,323
What about the toe?

1162
00:53:44,323 --> 00:53:45,823
Forget about
the fucking toe!

1163
00:53:45,913 --> 00:53:47,872
Excuse me, sir,

1164
00:53:47,912 --> 00:53:49,242
Could you please
keep your voices down?

1165
00:53:49,372 --> 00:53:50,871
This is a family restaurant.

1166
00:53:50,871 --> 00:53:52,201
Oh, please, dear.

1167
00:53:52,241 --> 00:53:54,290
For your information,
the supreme court

1168
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:56,829
has roundly rejected
prior restraint!

1169
00:53:56,869 --> 00:53:58,788
Walter, this is not
a first amendment thing.

1170
00:53:58,828 --> 00:54:00,248
If you don't calm down,

1171
00:54:00,248 --> 00:54:01,787
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

1172
00:54:01,877 --> 00:54:05,206
Lady, I got buddies who
died face down in the muck

1173
00:54:05,296 --> 00:54:08,295
so you and I could enjoy
this family restaurant!

1174
00:54:08,335 --> 00:54:09,835
All right,
I'm outta here.

1175
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:11,294
Hey, Dude,
don't go away, man.

1176
00:54:11,294 --> 00:54:13,254
Come on, this affects
all of us, man.

1177
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:15,713
Our basic freedoms!

1178
00:54:20,301 --> 00:54:21,301
I'm stayin'.

1179
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,889
I'm finishing my coffee.

1180
00:54:30,348 --> 00:54:32,427
Enjoying my coffee.

1181
00:54:47,812 --> 00:54:50,811
: The Dude is not in.

1182
00:54:50,811 --> 00:54:52,770
: Leave a message
after the beep.

1183
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,230
: Thanks, man.

1184
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,359
Mr. Lebowski, this is
duty officer Rolvaag

1185
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:58,858
of the LAPD.

1186
00:54:58,858 --> 00:55:00,358
We've recovered
your automobile.

1187
00:55:00,448 --> 00:55:02,777
It can be claimed at the
North Hollywood auto circus

1188
00:55:02,857 --> 00:55:03,737
there on Victory.

1189
00:55:03,777 --> 00:55:05,236
Far out, man.

1190
00:55:05,276 --> 00:55:06,906
Far fucking out!

1191
00:55:17,782 --> 00:55:20,451
This is a private
residence, man.

1192
00:55:28,378 --> 00:55:31,497
Ah, nice marmot.

1193
00:55:40,334 --> 00:55:45,173
Ve vant the money,
Lebowski.

1194
00:55:49,841 --> 00:55:52,300
You think
ve are kidding

1195
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:54,260
Or making with
the funny stuff?

1196
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,299
There are things

1197
00:55:55,349 --> 00:55:57,259
you haven't dreamed of,
Lebowski.

1198
00:55:57,309 --> 00:55:58,308
Ja. Ve believe
in nothing.

1199
00:55:58,348 --> 00:56:00,268
He believes in nothing,
Lebowski, nothing.

1200
00:56:00,308 --> 00:56:01,767
and tomorrow
ve come back

1201
00:56:01,807 --> 00:56:02,807
and ve cut off
your chonson.

1202
00:56:02,847 --> 00:56:04,266
Excuse me?

1203
00:56:04,266 --> 00:56:05,806
I said we'll cut off
Your Johnson!

1204
00:56:05,896 --> 00:56:08,305
Just think about that,
Lebowski.

1205
00:56:08,355 --> 00:56:11,434
Ja, your viggly penis,
Lebowski.

1206
00:56:11,474 --> 00:56:15,563
Ja, and maybe we stomp on it
and sqoosh it, Lebowski.

1207
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,820
It was discovered
last night in Van Nuys

1208
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:27,399
lodged against
an abutment.

1209
00:56:27,439 --> 00:56:28,448
Oh, man, lodged where?

1210
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:30,408
You're lucky she
didn't get chopped,

1211
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:31,447
Mr. Lebowski.

1212
00:56:32,567 --> 00:56:33,946
Must've been
a joyride situation.

1213
00:56:34,026 --> 00:56:35,446
They abandoned
the vehicle

1214
00:56:35,446 --> 00:56:36,486
once they hit
the retaining wall.

1215
00:56:36,486 --> 00:56:38,445
Oh, my
fucking briefcase!

1216
00:56:38,535 --> 00:56:40,404
Man, it's not here.
Shit!

1217
00:56:40,494 --> 00:56:41,404
Yeah, I saw that
on the report. Sorry.

1218
00:56:41,404 --> 00:56:44,413
You gotta get in
on the other side.

1219
00:56:44,413 --> 00:56:47,372
The side-view was
found on the road

1220
00:56:47,492 --> 00:56:49,911
by the car.

1221
00:56:49,911 --> 00:56:51,870
You're lucky they left
the tape deck, though,

1222
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,910
And the Creedence.

1223
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:57,379
Aw, Jesus!
What's that smell, man?

1224
00:56:57,459 --> 00:56:59,418
Probably a vagrant
slept in the car

1225
00:56:59,418 --> 00:57:02,417
or maybe just used it
as a toilet and moved on.

1226
00:57:04,966 --> 00:57:07,375
Are you gonna find
these guys or, you know,

1227
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:10,964
I mean, you got any
promising, uh, leads or...

1228
00:57:11,044 --> 00:57:12,384
Leads?

1229
00:57:12,424 --> 00:57:14,963
Yeah. Sure.

1230
00:57:14,963 --> 00:57:17,052
I'll just check
with the boys

1231
00:57:17,052 --> 00:57:17,882
down at
the crime lab.

1232
00:57:17,922 --> 00:57:20,471
They, got
4 more detectives

1233
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:21,970
Working on the case.

1234
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:24,470
They got us
working in shifts.

1235
00:57:29,058 --> 00:57:30,977
Leads.

1236
00:57:31,017 --> 00:57:34,516
My only hope is that
the big Lebowski kills me

1237
00:57:34,596 --> 00:57:36,436
Before the Germans
can cut my dick off.

1238
00:57:36,436 --> 00:57:38,355
Now, that is just
ridiculous, Dude.

1239
00:57:38,395 --> 00:57:39,814
No one's going to
cut your dick off.

1240
00:57:39,854 --> 00:57:41,274
Thank you, Walter.

1241
00:57:41,314 --> 00:57:42,813
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

1242
00:57:42,853 --> 00:57:43,813
Thank you, Walter.

1243
00:57:43,853 --> 00:57:45,902
That makes me feel
very secure.

1244
00:57:45,942 --> 00:57:46,852
Dude.

1245
00:57:46,852 --> 00:57:48,442
That makes me feel
very warm inside.

1246
00:57:48,521 --> 00:57:49,401
Now, Dude.

1247
00:57:49,481 --> 00:57:51,900
This whole
fuckin' thing.

1248
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:52,940
I could be sitting here

1249
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:55,439
with just pee stains
on my rug.

1250
00:57:55,489 --> 00:57:56,489
Yeah.

1251
00:57:56,529 --> 00:57:57,988
But, no, man,
I gotta, you know.

1252
00:57:58,028 --> 00:57:59,028
Fucking Germans.

1253
00:57:59,068 --> 00:58:00,987
Nothing changes.

1254
00:58:01,027 --> 00:58:02,947
Fucking Nazis.

1255
00:58:02,987 --> 00:58:03,946
They were Nazis, Dude?

1256
00:58:03,986 --> 00:58:05,326
Oh, come on, Donny.

1257
00:58:05,406 --> 00:58:07,365
They were threatening
castration.

1258
00:58:07,405 --> 00:58:08,905
Are we gonna
split hairs here?

1259
00:58:09,994 --> 00:58:10,824
Am I wrong?

1260
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:11,864
Well, he..

1261
00:58:11,994 --> 00:58:13,373
They were
nihilists, man.

1262
00:58:14,453 --> 00:58:16,372
They kept saying
they believed in nothing.

1263
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:18,541
Nihilists.

1264
00:58:19,501 --> 00:58:21,001
Fuck me.

1265
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,370
I mean,
say what you want

1266
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:24,959
about the tenets

1267
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:25,879
of national
Socialism, Dude.

1268
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,498
At least
it's an ethos.

1269
00:58:27,538 --> 00:58:29,458
And also,
let's not forget

1270
00:58:29,458 --> 00:58:30,957
Let’s not forget,
Dude

1271
00:58:31,047 --> 00:58:32,877
That keeping
wildlife, um,

1272
00:58:32,877 --> 00:58:34,376
an amphibious rodent

1273
00:58:34,376 --> 00:58:36,795
for, um, you know,
domestic...

1274
00:58:36,875 --> 00:58:39,884
Within the city...

1275
00:58:39,884 --> 00:58:41,384
That ain't legal
either.

1276
00:58:41,504 --> 00:58:43,343
What are you,
a fucking park ranger now?

1277
00:58:43,423 --> 00:58:45,382
No, I'm
just trying

1278
00:58:45,382 --> 00:58:47,932
Who gives a shit
about the fucking marmot?

1279
00:58:47,932 --> 00:58:49,891
We are sympathizing
here, Dude.

1280
00:58:49,891 --> 00:58:50,971
Fuck sympathy.

1281
00:58:51,051 --> 00:58:53,470
I don't need your
fucking sympathy, man.

1282
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:56,019
I need my
fucking Johnson.

1283
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:57,468
What do you need
that for, Dude?

1284
00:58:57,468 --> 00:58:59,018
You have got to
buck up, man!

1285
00:58:59,098 --> 00:59:00,937
You cannot drag
this negative energy

1286
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:02,437
Into the tournament.

1287
00:59:02,517 --> 00:59:05,056
Fuck the tournament.
Fuck you, Walter.

1288
00:59:07,475 --> 00:59:10,024
Fuck the tournament?

1289
00:59:10,024 --> 00:59:11,394
Ok, Dude. I can see

1290
00:59:11,484 --> 00:59:12,443
you don't want to be
cheered up here.

1291
00:59:12,523 --> 00:59:13,443
Come on, Donny.

1292
00:59:13,443 --> 00:59:14,903
Let's go get us
a lane.

1293
00:59:19,981 --> 00:59:21,940
Another Caucasian, Gary.

1294
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:23,440
Right, Dude.

1295
00:59:25,029 --> 00:59:26,989
Friends like these,
huh, Gary?

1296
00:59:26,989 --> 00:59:28,948
That's right, Dude.

1297
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:54,459
Do you have
A good sarsaparilla?

1298
00:59:54,539 --> 00:59:56,918
Sioux city sarsaparilla?

1299
00:59:56,958 --> 00:59:59,498
Yeah. That's a good one.

1300
01:00:01,917 --> 01:00:03,796
How you doin'
there, Dude?

1301
01:00:03,876 --> 01:00:06,335
Not too good, man.

1302
01:00:06,385 --> 01:00:08,425
One of those days, huh?

1303
01:00:10,464 --> 01:00:11,384
Well...

1304
01:00:11,424 --> 01:00:15,422
A wiser fella than myself
once said,

1305
01:00:15,472 --> 01:00:18,431
"Sometimes you eat
the bar and"

1306
01:00:18,471 --> 01:00:20,511
Much obliged.

1307
01:00:20,551 --> 01:00:23,929
"And sometimes
the bar, well...

1308
01:00:23,969 --> 01:00:25,429
He eats you."

1309
01:00:25,469 --> 01:00:28,848
That some kind
of eastern thing?

1310
01:00:28,888 --> 01:00:30,977
Far from it.

1311
01:00:37,065 --> 01:00:40,024
I like your style,
Dude.

1312
01:00:40,024 --> 01:00:41,983
Well...

1313
01:00:42,063 --> 01:00:44,483
I dig your style, too,
man.

1314
01:00:44,483 --> 01:00:47,572
You got
a whole cowboy thing going.

1315
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:55,069
There's just one thing,
Dude.

1316
01:00:55,069 --> 01:00:56,449
And what's that?

1317
01:00:56,529 --> 01:01:00,157
Do you have to use
so many cuss words?

1318
01:01:02,536 --> 01:01:04,616
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1319
01:01:07,575 --> 01:01:10,574
Have it your way.

1320
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,080
Call for you, Dude.

1321
01:01:27,588 --> 01:01:30,467
Jeffrey, you have
not gone to the doctor.

1322
01:01:30,547 --> 01:01:33,506
..no, I haven't yet.

1323
01:01:34,586 --> 01:01:37,095
I'd like to see you
immediately.

1324
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,180
So you're Lebowski.

1325
01:01:56,978 --> 01:01:59,228
Maude has told me
all about you.

1326
01:01:59,307 --> 01:02:01,307
She'll be back
in a minute. Sit down.

1327
01:02:01,397 --> 01:02:03,226
Do you want a drink?

1328
01:02:03,226 --> 01:02:05,685
Yeah, sure.
White Russian.

1329
01:02:05,725 --> 01:02:07,815
The bar's over there.

1330
01:02:12,313 --> 01:02:15,112
So what do you do,
Lebowski?

1331
01:02:15,192 --> 01:02:17,231
Who the fuck are you,
man?

1332
01:02:18,281 --> 01:02:20,151
Just a friend
of Maudie's.

1333
01:02:20,151 --> 01:02:22,150
Yeah, the friend
with the cleft asshole?

1334
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:26,738
What do you do?

1335
01:02:26,778 --> 01:02:28,698
Oh, nothing much.

1336
01:02:31,237 --> 01:02:32,696
Yeah, how are you?

1337
01:02:32,746 --> 01:02:33,616
Listen, Maude,

1338
01:02:33,656 --> 01:02:36,785
I got to, ...

1339
01:02:38,204 --> 01:02:41,203
Tender my resignation
or whatever,

1340
01:02:41,203 --> 01:02:43,743
Because, ...it
looks like your mother

1341
01:02:43,743 --> 01:02:45,702
really was kidnapped
after all.

1342
01:02:45,752 --> 01:02:48,671
She most certainly
was not.

1343
01:02:48,791 --> 01:02:51,750
Hey, man, why
don't you fucking...

1344
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:53,249
Listen occasionally?

1345
01:02:53,289 --> 01:02:54,209
You might
learn something.

1346
01:02:56,248 --> 01:02:57,798
Please don't call her
my mother.

1347
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:00,167
She's most definitely
the perpetrator

1348
01:03:00,217 --> 01:03:01,757
and not the victim.

1349
01:03:01,757 --> 01:03:04,756
I'm telling you, I got
pretty definitive evidence

1350
01:03:04,846 --> 01:03:05,675
From who?

1351
01:03:05,755 --> 01:03:07,305
From the main guy--
Oolie.

1352
01:03:07,305 --> 01:03:08,764
Oolie Coco?

1353
01:03:08,764 --> 01:03:10,714
Her co-star in
the beaver picture?

1354
01:03:10,714 --> 01:03:13,593
Beaver?
you mean vagina

1355
01:03:13,683 --> 01:03:16,092
I mean,
you know the guy?

1356
01:03:16,182 --> 01:03:18,141
I might have introduced them
for all I know.

1357
01:03:18,141 --> 01:03:20,140
Do you remember Oolie?

1358
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:23,679
He's a musician. Used
to have a group Autobahn.

1359
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:25,179
Look in my LP's.

1360
01:03:25,269 --> 01:03:28,148
They released one album
in the late seventies.

1361
01:03:28,268 --> 01:03:31,267
Their music is sort of
a techno pop.

1362
01:03:31,267 --> 01:03:33,726
So he's pretending to be
the abductor?

1363
01:03:33,816 --> 01:03:34,726
Well, yeah.

1364
01:03:34,726 --> 01:03:37,735
Look, Jeffrey, you don't
really kidnap someone

1365
01:03:37,735 --> 01:03:38,774
you're acquainted with.

1366
01:03:38,774 --> 01:03:39,564
The whole idea

1367
01:03:39,604 --> 01:03:41,103
is that the hostage can't
be able to identify you

1368
01:03:41,153 --> 01:03:42,733
after you've let them go.

1369
01:03:42,733 --> 01:03:44,232
I know that.

1370
01:03:47,691 --> 01:03:50,240
What the fuck
is with this guy?

1371
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,740
Who is he?

1372
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:52,739
Knox Harrington.

1373
01:03:52,739 --> 01:03:54,239
The video artist.

1374
01:03:55,699 --> 01:03:57,238
So Oolie
has the money?

1375
01:03:57,238 --> 01:03:58,658
Well...

1376
01:03:58,697 --> 01:04:01,157
..no, not exactly.

1377
01:04:02,286 --> 01:04:04,825
This is a very
complicated case, Maude.

1378
01:04:05,705 --> 01:04:06,665
A lot of ins,
a lot of outs,

1379
01:04:06,745 --> 01:04:09,164
a lot of what-have-yous,
and,

1380
01:04:09,204 --> 01:04:11,203
a lot of strands
to keep in my head, man.

1381
01:04:11,243 --> 01:04:13,293
A lot of strands
in old Duder's head.

1382
01:04:14,252 --> 01:04:15,712
If Oolie doesn't have it,
then who does?

1383
01:04:15,752 --> 01:04:18,711
It's Sandra,
about the Bearnali.

1384
01:04:18,711 --> 01:04:20,210
..look,
I have to take this.

1385
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:22,210
Do you still have
that doctor's number?

1386
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:24,169
No, really. It's
not even bruised anymore.

1387
01:04:24,209 --> 01:04:25,798
Oh, please, Jeffrey,

1388
01:04:25,838 --> 01:04:26,708
I don't want
to be responsible

1389
01:04:26,758 --> 01:04:28,837
For any delayed
after-effects.

1390
01:04:30,297 --> 01:04:31,297
After-effects?

1391
01:05:01,766 --> 01:05:03,566
Could you slide
your shorts down,

1392
01:05:03,606 --> 01:05:05,355
Mr. Lebowski, please?

1393
01:05:07,105 --> 01:05:09,064
No. No, man.
She hit me right here.

1394
01:05:09,104 --> 01:05:10,693
I understand.

1395
01:05:10,693 --> 01:05:13,362
Could you slide
your shorts down, please?

1396
01:05:23,949 --> 01:05:26,368
# Just got home
from Illinois #

1397
01:05:26,448 --> 01:05:28,907
# Lock the front door,
oh, boy #

1398
01:05:28,997 --> 01:05:32,786
# Got to sit down,
take a rest on the porch #

1399
01:05:32,786 --> 01:05:35,285
# Imagination sets in #

1400
01:05:35,285 --> 01:05:37,744
# Pretty soon I'm singin' #

1401
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:39,334
# Doo doo doo #

1402
01:05:39,334 --> 01:05:41,873
# Lookin' out my back door #

1403
01:05:41,873 --> 01:05:44,292
# There's a giant
doing cartwheels #

1404
01:05:44,372 --> 01:05:46,791
# A statue
wearin' high heels #

1405
01:05:46,921 --> 01:05:49,290
# Look at all
the happy creatures #

1406
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:51,300
# Dancin' on the lawn #

1407
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:53,379
# A dinosaur Victrola #

1408
01:05:53,459 --> 01:05:56,338
# Listenin' to Buck Owens #

1409
01:05:56,338 --> 01:05:57,838
# Doo doo doo #

1410
01:05:57,928 --> 01:05:58,837
# Lookin' out my back door #

1411
01:05:58,837 --> 01:06:00,217
Ow! Ooh! Ooh!

1412
01:06:00,217 --> 01:06:04,385
# Tambourines and elephants
are playing in the band #

1413
01:06:07,804 --> 01:06:09,344
# Wondrous apparition #

1414
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:12,303
# Provided by magician #

1415
01:06:12,303 --> 01:06:13,802
# Doo doo doo #

1416
01:06:13,892 --> 01:06:17,011
# Lookin' out my back door #

1417
01:06:34,815 --> 01:06:36,735
# Tambourines
and elephants #

1418
01:06:36,775 --> 01:06:39,234
# Are playing in the band #

1419
01:06:39,274 --> 01:06:42,783
# Won't you take a ride
on the flyin' spoon? #

1420
01:06:42,783 --> 01:06:44,322
# Doo doo doo #

1421
01:06:44,402 --> 01:06:46,241
# Bother me tomorrow #

1422
01:06:46,281 --> 01:06:48,781
# Today I'll buy
no sorrows #

1423
01:06:48,861 --> 01:06:50,820
# Doo doo doo #

1424
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:54,119
# Lookin' out my back door #

1425
01:07:45,671 --> 01:07:47,251
He lives
in north Hollywood,

1426
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:49,750
on Radford, near
the in-n-out burger.

1427
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,260
The in-n-out burger's
on Camrose.

1428
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:52,719
Near
the in-n-out burger.

1429
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:54,678
Those are good burgers,
Walter.

1430
01:07:54,678 --> 01:07:56,178
Shut the fuck up,
Donny.

1431
01:07:56,178 --> 01:07:57,218
The kid is in
ninth grade, Dude,

1432
01:07:57,218 --> 01:08:00,217
And his father is
Are you ready for this?

1433
01:08:00,217 --> 01:08:02,776
His father is
Arthur Digby Sellers.

1434
01:08:02,816 --> 01:08:04,815
Who the fuck is that?

1435
01:08:05,855 --> 01:08:07,684
Who the fuck is
Arthur Digby Sellers?

1436
01:08:07,774 --> 01:08:10,743
Ever heard of a little show
called branded, Dude?

1437
01:08:10,783 --> 01:08:11,703
Yes, I know

1438
01:08:11,703 --> 01:08:13,782
All but one man died
there at bitter creek?

1439
01:08:13,782 --> 01:08:16,741
I know the fucking show,
Walter. So what?

1440
01:08:16,781 --> 01:08:19,580
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers
wrote 156 episodes, Dude.

1441
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:22,119
The bulk
of the series.

1442
01:08:23,169 --> 01:08:24,628
Not exactly
a lightweight.

1443
01:08:25,708 --> 01:08:28,137
And yet his son
is a fucking dunce.

1444
01:08:29,757 --> 01:08:32,676
Anyway, we'll go there
after the what-have-you,

1445
01:08:32,716 --> 01:08:34,295
we'll brace the kid,
should be a pushover.

1446
01:08:34,345 --> 01:08:35,805
We'll be near
the in-n-out burger.

1447
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:38,814
Shut the fuck up,
Donny!

1448
01:08:38,854 --> 01:08:40,723
We'll go out there,
we'll brace the kid,

1449
01:08:40,813 --> 01:08:42,852
He should be a pushover.

1450
01:08:42,892 --> 01:08:44,772
We'll get that fucking
$1 million back

1451
01:08:44,812 --> 01:08:47,321
If he hasn't spent it
already.

1452
01:08:47,361 --> 01:08:48,650
A million fucking clams.

1453
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:51,190
And yes, we'll be near
the ..

1454
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:52,779
In-n-out.

1455
01:08:53,739 --> 01:08:54,748
Some burgers,

1456
01:08:54,788 --> 01:08:55,788
some beers,

1457
01:08:55,828 --> 01:08:56,748
a few laughs.

1458
01:08:58,827 --> 01:09:02,416
Our fucking troubles
are over, Dude.

1459
01:09:13,892 --> 01:09:16,721
Oh, fuck me, man!

1460
01:09:16,801 --> 01:09:20,140
That kid's already spent
all the money, man!

1461
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:21,759
New 'vette?
Hardly, Dude.

1462
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:26,728
I'd say he still has
960, $970,000 left,

1463
01:09:26,818 --> 01:09:28,777
depending on the options.

1464
01:09:28,777 --> 01:09:29,817
Wait in the car, Donny.

1465
01:09:33,076 --> 01:09:33,995
Yes?

1466
01:09:33,995 --> 01:09:35,455
Pilar?

1467
01:09:36,994 --> 01:09:38,454
My name
is Walter Sobchak.

1468
01:09:38,454 --> 01:09:41,463
This is my associate
Jeffrey Lebowski.

1469
01:09:41,463 --> 01:09:43,832
Um, we came to talk
about little Larry.

1470
01:09:43,832 --> 01:09:45,371
May we come in?

1471
01:09:45,461 --> 01:09:46,831
Yes, yes.

1472
01:09:46,921 --> 01:09:47,831
Thank you.

1473
01:09:52,509 --> 01:09:54,138
That's him, Dude.

1474
01:10:01,606 --> 01:10:04,105
And a good day to you,
Sir!

1475
01:10:04,105 --> 01:10:06,774
..sit down, please.

1476
01:10:11,573 --> 01:10:14,532
Larry, sweetie,
that man is here!

1477
01:10:14,572 --> 01:10:15,941
Is he...

1478
01:10:16,031 --> 01:10:17,581
Does he still write?

1479
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,999
He has health problems.

1480
01:10:23,499 --> 01:10:26,008
Sir, I just
want to say ...

1481
01:10:26,048 --> 01:10:27,547
that we're both..

1482
01:10:27,547 --> 01:10:29,637
on a personal level...

1483
01:10:29,637 --> 01:10:32,636
Really enormous fans.

1484
01:10:32,716 --> 01:10:36,104
Branded, especially
the early episodes,

1485
01:10:36,184 --> 01:10:38,184
was truly a source
of inspiration

1486
01:10:38,264 --> 01:10:39,513
Sweetie, sit down!

1487
01:10:39,603 --> 01:10:40,553
This man
is the police.

1488
01:10:41,683 --> 01:10:43,062
we didn't want
to give the impression

1489
01:10:43,102 --> 01:10:44,112
that we were police
exactly.

1490
01:10:44,152 --> 01:10:46,151
We're hoping
it won't be necessary

1491
01:10:46,191 --> 01:10:47,031
to call the police.

1492
01:10:47,111 --> 01:10:50,030
But that's up
to little Larry here.

1493
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:51,569
Isn't it, Larry?

1494
01:11:02,166 --> 01:11:04,715
Is this your homework,
Larry?

1495
01:11:05,625 --> 01:11:07,624
Is this your homework,
Larry?

1496
01:11:07,674 --> 01:11:08,544
Look, man

1497
01:11:08,544 --> 01:11:09,583
Dude, please.

1498
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:11,503
Is this your homework,
Larry?

1499
01:11:11,543 --> 01:11:13,472
Just ask him
about the car, man.

1500
01:11:13,542 --> 01:11:14,512
Is this yours, Larry?

1501
01:11:14,582 --> 01:11:16,011
Is this your homework,
Larry?

1502
01:11:16,011 --> 01:11:17,640
Is that your car
out front?

1503
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:18,470
Is this your homework,
Larry?

1504
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:20,060
We know it's
his fucking homework!

1505
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:22,519
Where's the fucking money,
you little brat?

1506
01:11:22,609 --> 01:11:24,608
Look, Larry...

1507
01:11:24,608 --> 01:11:25,648
Have you ever heard
of Vietnam?

1508
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:27,567
You're entering
a world of pain, son.

1509
01:11:27,567 --> 01:11:29,157
we know that this is
your homework.

1510
01:11:29,187 --> 01:11:30,616
We know that you stole
the car.

1511
01:11:30,616 --> 01:11:32,116
And the fucking money!

1512
01:11:32,116 --> 01:11:33,615
And the fucking money.

1513
01:11:33,695 --> 01:11:35,115
And we know that this
is your homework.

1514
01:11:35,155 --> 01:11:36,524
We're gonna cut
your dick off, Larry.

1515
01:11:36,524 --> 01:11:39,203
You're killing
your father, Larry.

1516
01:11:41,043 --> 01:11:42,542
All right.

1517
01:11:42,542 --> 01:11:44,042
This is pointless.

1518
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:48,590
It's time for plan "b."

1519
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:53,548
You might want to watch out
that front window, Larry.

1520
01:11:53,548 --> 01:11:55,638
Son, this is what happens

1521
01:11:55,638 --> 01:11:58,187
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass!

1522
01:11:59,806 --> 01:12:01,186
Little language problem
here.

1523
01:12:01,186 --> 01:12:04,605
The little prick's
stonewalling me.

1524
01:12:06,694 --> 01:12:08,653
What...are you doing,
man?

1525
01:12:11,193 --> 01:12:13,232
What are you doing?

1526
01:12:14,102 --> 01:12:15,701
Here you go, Larry.

1527
01:12:15,701 --> 01:12:18,080
You see what happens?

1528
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:21,039
You see what happens,
Larry?

1529
01:12:21,159 --> 01:12:23,119
You see what happens?

1530
01:12:23,249 --> 01:12:24,628
This is what happens

1531
01:12:24,718 --> 01:12:26,617
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass, Larry!

1532
01:12:29,256 --> 01:12:31,176
This is what happens,
Larry!

1533
01:12:31,216 --> 01:12:33,135
You see what happens,
Larry?

1534
01:12:33,135 --> 01:12:34,595
You see what happens

1535
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,094
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass?

1536
01:12:36,144 --> 01:12:37,594
This is what happens.

1537
01:12:37,594 --> 01:12:39,683
You see what happens,
Larry?

1538
01:12:40,553 --> 01:12:41,512
You see what happens,
Larry?

1539
01:12:41,602 --> 01:12:44,191
Do you see what happens,
Larry,

1540
01:12:44,191 --> 01:12:46,731
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass?

1541
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:51,609
This is what happens,
Larry!

1542
01:12:51,739 --> 01:12:52,649
No!

1543
01:12:52,789 --> 01:12:54,038
This is what happens,
Larry!

1544
01:12:54,118 --> 01:12:55,078
This is what happens

1545
01:12:55,158 --> 01:12:56,697
when you fuck a stranger

1546
01:12:56,697 --> 01:12:58,197
What the fuck
are you doing, man?!

1547
01:12:58,197 --> 01:12:59,156
Stop it!

1548
01:12:59,196 --> 01:13:01,586
I just bought
that fucking car last week!

1549
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:02,625
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1550
01:13:02,625 --> 01:13:04,045
I'm gonna
fuckin' kill you!

1551
01:13:04,075 --> 01:13:07,084
I just bought
the fucking car last week!

1552
01:13:07,124 --> 01:13:09,593
I'll kill your
fucking car, man!

1553
01:13:09,673 --> 01:13:11,722
No! No! Hey! Hey!
That's not his hey!

1554
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:13,052
God damn it!

1555
01:13:16,181 --> 01:13:17,590
You like that?

1556
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:24,928
I kill your fucking car!

1557
01:13:45,251 --> 01:13:46,671
I accept your apology.

1558
01:13:46,761 --> 01:13:49,760
No. I just..

1559
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,759
Want to handle it
by myself from now on.

1560
01:13:54,808 --> 01:13:58,137
That has nothing
to do with it.

1561
01:13:58,227 --> 01:14:00,186
Yes, the car made it home.

1562
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:02,645
You're calling me at home.

1563
01:14:04,235 --> 01:14:06,724
it did not look like...

1564
01:14:06,724 --> 01:14:09,153
Larry was about to crack.

1565
01:14:09,233 --> 01:14:12,272
Well,
that's your perception.

1566
01:14:13,202 --> 01:14:16,201
You know, Walter,
you're right.

1567
01:14:16,281 --> 01:14:18,660
There is
an unspoken message here.

1568
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:19,700
It's fuck you!

1569
01:14:19,829 --> 01:14:21,799
Leave me the fuck alone!

1570
01:14:23,758 --> 01:14:26,877
Yeah, I'll be at practice.

1571
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,221
Pin your diapers on,
Lebowski.

1572
01:14:45,401 --> 01:14:47,270
Jackie Treehorn
wants to see you.

1573
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:50,819
Jackie Treehorn knows
which Lebowski you are.

1574
01:14:50,869 --> 01:14:53,238
Jackie Treehorn wants to see
the deadbeat Lebowski.

1575
01:14:53,278 --> 01:14:55,987
You're not dealing
with morons here.

1576
01:15:42,912 --> 01:15:44,461
Hello, Dude.

1577
01:15:44,461 --> 01:15:45,921
Thanks for coming.

1578
01:15:45,961 --> 01:15:47,830
I'm Jackie Treehorn.

1579
01:15:49,869 --> 01:15:53,388
This is quite a pad
you got here, man.

1580
01:15:53,428 --> 01:15:55,347
Completely unspoiled.

1581
01:15:55,427 --> 01:15:57,427
What's your drink, Dude?

1582
01:15:57,517 --> 01:15:59,476
White Russian.
Thanks.

1583
01:15:59,516 --> 01:16:01,775
White Russian.

1584
01:16:01,775 --> 01:16:03,945
How's the smut business,
Jackie?

1585
01:16:03,945 --> 01:16:05,944
I wouldn't know,
Dude.

1586
01:16:05,944 --> 01:16:08,023
I deal in publishing,

1587
01:16:08,023 --> 01:16:08,943
entertainment,

1588
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:11,162
political advocacy.

1589
01:16:11,162 --> 01:16:12,622
Oh. Which one's
Logjamming?

1590
01:16:12,622 --> 01:16:14,571
Yes, regrettably,
it's true.

1591
01:16:14,571 --> 01:16:17,410
Standards have fallen
in adult entertainment.

1592
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:18,910
It's video, Dude.

1593
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:21,589
Now that we're competing
with those amateurs,

1594
01:16:21,589 --> 01:16:25,497
We can't afford to invest
in little extras, like story,

1595
01:16:25,587 --> 01:16:27,487
production value,

1596
01:16:27,487 --> 01:16:29,926
feelings.

1597
01:16:30,016 --> 01:16:32,515
You know, people forget

1598
01:16:32,595 --> 01:16:37,093
that the brain is
the biggest erogenous zone.

1599
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:38,603
On you maybe.

1600
01:16:38,603 --> 01:16:40,562
Of course, you have to take
the good with the bad.

1601
01:16:40,562 --> 01:16:43,441
New technology permits us
to do very exciting things

1602
01:16:43,481 --> 01:16:45,941
In interactive
erotic software.

1603
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:47,570
Wave of the future,
Dude.

1604
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:50,989
100% electronic.

1605
01:16:50,989 --> 01:16:52,438
Well...

1606
01:16:52,518 --> 01:16:55,157
I still jerk off
manually.

1607
01:16:56,497 --> 01:16:57,537
Of course you do.

1608
01:16:57,537 --> 01:16:59,036
I can see you're anxious

1609
01:16:59,036 --> 01:17:00,536
for me to get to the point.

1610
01:17:00,626 --> 01:17:03,035
Well, here it is, Dude.

1611
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:04,984
Where's Bunny?

1612
01:17:05,124 --> 01:17:07,003
Well, I thought you
might know that, man.

1613
01:17:07,043 --> 01:17:08,503
Why would I?

1614
01:17:08,553 --> 01:17:10,092
She only ran off

1615
01:17:10,092 --> 01:17:12,422
to get away from that
rather sizable debt to me.

1616
01:17:12,462 --> 01:17:14,891
No. She didn't run off.
She's been..

1617
01:17:14,971 --> 01:17:16,850
I've heard that kidnapping
story, so save it.

1618
01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:19,929
I know you're mixed up
in all this, Dude,

1619
01:17:19,979 --> 01:17:23,488
And I don't care what you're
trying to get from the husband.

1620
01:17:23,528 --> 01:17:24,947
That's your business.

1621
01:17:24,987 --> 01:17:27,607
All I'm saying is...

1622
01:17:27,647 --> 01:17:29,106
I want mine.

1623
01:17:29,156 --> 01:17:30,606
Yeah, right, man.

1624
01:17:30,656 --> 01:17:32,705
I mean, there are
a lot of, um,

1625
01:17:32,745 --> 01:17:36,744
Facets to this, a lot
of interested parties.

1626
01:17:37,703 --> 01:17:39,163
Excuse me.

1627
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:48,550
Where's that?

1628
01:17:52,138 --> 01:17:53,598
All right.

1629
01:17:57,557 --> 01:17:58,556
Excuse me.

1630
01:18:34,094 --> 01:18:35,554
Forgive me.

1631
01:18:35,634 --> 01:18:38,063
No problemo, man.

1632
01:18:39,522 --> 01:18:43,981
If I can find
your money...

1633
01:18:43,981 --> 01:18:47,030
Uh, what's in it
for The Dude?

1634
01:18:47,110 --> 01:18:48,609
Well, of course,
there's that to discuss.

1635
01:18:48,609 --> 01:18:50,239
Uh, refill?

1636
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:51,778
Yeah. The pope
shit in the woods?

1637
01:18:51,858 --> 01:18:53,238
10% finder's fee.

1638
01:18:53,278 --> 01:18:54,288
That all right?

1639
01:18:55,327 --> 01:18:56,287
Done, Jackie.

1640
01:18:56,367 --> 01:18:59,736
Yeah. I dig the way
you do business, man.

1641
01:18:59,826 --> 01:19:01,325
Your money
is being held

1642
01:19:01,325 --> 01:19:03,674
By a kid named
Larry Sellers.

1643
01:19:03,714 --> 01:19:05,214
He lives
in north Hollywood,

1644
01:19:05,214 --> 01:19:06,713
On Radford ...

1645
01:19:06,793 --> 01:19:09,842
by the
in-n-out burger.

1646
01:19:09,922 --> 01:19:12,891
A fuckin' brat,
but I'm sure your goons

1647
01:19:12,931 --> 01:19:16,770
can get it off him.
I mean, he's 15.

1648
01:19:16,810 --> 01:19:19,929
Flunking social studies.

1649
01:19:23,438 --> 01:19:25,897
So, if you could just ..

1650
01:19:25,937 --> 01:19:29,856
Write me a check for my
10% of half a million...

1651
01:19:29,886 --> 01:19:32,285
5 grand...

1652
01:19:32,325 --> 01:19:33,824
I'll go out and mingle

1653
01:19:37,863 --> 01:19:40,832
You mix a hell
of a Caucasian, Jackie.

1654
01:19:41,882 --> 01:19:44,381
A 15-year-old kid.

1655
01:19:44,421 --> 01:19:48,289
Is this
some sort of a joke?

1656
01:19:48,379 --> 01:19:49,929
No, no joke.

1657
01:19:49,929 --> 01:19:53,808
No funny stuff, Jackie.
the kid's got it.

1658
01:19:53,878 --> 01:19:55,387
Hi, fellas.

1659
01:19:58,026 --> 01:20:00,105
The kid just wanted
a car.

1660
01:20:02,895 --> 01:20:06,773
All The Dude ever wanted
was his rug back.

1661
01:20:06,823 --> 01:20:08,443
I'm not greedy.

1662
01:20:09,322 --> 01:20:12,821
It would really...

1663
01:20:12,901 --> 01:20:14,451
Tie the room together.

1664
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:19,789
Darkness washed over The Dude.

1665
01:20:19,869 --> 01:20:22,878
Darker than
a black steer's took us

1666
01:20:22,878 --> 01:20:25,837
on a moonless prairie night.

1667
01:20:25,837 --> 01:20:29,376
There was no bottom.

1668
01:20:45,650 --> 01:20:49,399
# What condition
 my condition was in #

1669
01:20:51,148 --> 01:20:54,247
# I woke up this morning
with the sun down #

1670
01:20:54,287 --> 01:20:56,866
# Shinin' in him #

1671
01:20:59,166 --> 01:21:04,134
# I found my mind
in a brown paper bag #

1672
01:21:04,174 --> 01:21:05,214
# But then #

1673
01:21:07,753 --> 01:21:11,682
# I tripped on a cloud
and fell 8 miles high #

1674
01:21:11,682 --> 01:21:15,850
# I tore my mind
on a jagged sky #

1675
01:21:15,850 --> 01:21:18,259
# I just dropped in #

1676
01:21:18,259 --> 01:21:22,858
# To see what condition
my condition was in #

1677
01:21:22,858 --> 01:21:25,227
# Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah #

1678
01:21:25,227 --> 01:21:28,146
# What condition
my condition was in #

1679
01:21:34,824 --> 01:21:38,583
# I pushed my soul
in a deep dark hole #

1680
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:41,282
# And then
I followed it in #

1681
01:21:43,291 --> 01:21:46,250
# I watched myself
crawlin' out #

1682
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:50,838
# As I was crawlin' in #

1683
01:21:50,838 --> 01:21:52,678
# I got up so tight #

1684
01:21:52,748 --> 01:21:55,217
# I couldn't unwind #

1685
01:21:55,257 --> 01:21:57,266
# I saw so much #

1686
01:21:57,316 --> 01:21:59,685
# I broke my mind #

1687
01:21:59,765 --> 01:22:01,725
# I just dropped in #

1688
01:22:01,765 --> 01:22:05,943
# To see what condition
my condition was in #

1689
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:17,370
# Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah #

1690
01:22:17,410 --> 01:22:20,948
# What condition
my condition was in #

1691
01:22:26,167 --> 01:22:29,795
# Someone
painted echoes on #

1692
01:22:29,925 --> 01:22:30,795
# In big black letters #

1693
01:22:30,795 --> 01:22:32,804
# On the dead inside #

1694
01:22:34,894 --> 01:22:36,853
# I kept my foot
on the gas #

1695
01:22:36,933 --> 01:22:38,712
# As I left the road #

1696
01:22:38,892 --> 01:22:42,271
# Blew out my mind #

1697
01:22:42,271 --> 01:22:46,780
# 8 miles out of Memphis,
and I got no spare #

1698
01:22:46,780 --> 01:22:51,228
# 8 miles straightened up
downtown somewhere #

1699
01:22:51,228 --> 01:22:53,317
# I just dropped in #

1700
01:22:53,317 --> 01:22:57,906
# To see what condition
my condition was in #

1701
01:22:59,415 --> 01:23:01,875
# I said,
I just dropped in #

1702
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:06,373
# To see what condition
my condition was in #

1703
01:24:13,910 --> 01:24:17,869
But the charge was true

1704
01:24:17,949 --> 01:24:22,298
and they say
he ran away

1705
01:24:22,298 --> 01:24:23,337
branded!

1706
01:24:37,143 --> 01:24:39,862
Is this your only I.D.?

1707
01:24:39,942 --> 01:24:42,021
I know my rights,
man.

1708
01:24:43,481 --> 01:24:46,400
You don't know shit,
Lebowski.

1709
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,449
I want
a fucking lawyer, man.

1710
01:24:48,449 --> 01:24:50,448
I want...

1711
01:24:50,448 --> 01:24:52,947
Bill Kunstler, man.

1712
01:24:54,577 --> 01:24:55,906
Or Ron Coobie.

1713
01:24:55,906 --> 01:24:57,506
Mr. Treehorn tells us

1714
01:24:57,586 --> 01:25:00,875
that he had to eject you
from his garden party,

1715
01:25:00,955 --> 01:25:04,004
that you were drunk
and abusive.

1716
01:25:04,004 --> 01:25:09,342
Mr. Treehorn treats objects
like women, man.

1717
01:25:09,472 --> 01:25:11,881
Mr. Treehorn draws
a lot of water in this town.

1718
01:25:11,881 --> 01:25:14,430
You don't draw shit,
Lebowski.

1719
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:17,939
Now we got a nice quiet
little beach community here,

1720
01:25:18,019 --> 01:25:19,978
and I aim to keep it
nice and quiet.

1721
01:25:19,978 --> 01:25:22,977
So let me
make something plain.

1722
01:25:22,977 --> 01:25:24,907
I don't like you
sucking around,

1723
01:25:24,987 --> 01:25:27,406
bothering our citizens,
Lebowski.

1724
01:25:27,446 --> 01:25:29,985
I don't like
your jerk-off name,

1725
01:25:29,985 --> 01:25:32,074
I don't like
your jerk-off face,

1726
01:25:32,074 --> 01:25:33,484
I don't like
your jerk-off behavior,

1727
01:25:33,534 --> 01:25:35,333
And I don't like you...

1728
01:25:35,413 --> 01:25:36,913
Jerk-off.

1729
01:25:39,502 --> 01:25:42,581
Do I make myself clear?

1730
01:25:44,590 --> 01:25:48,009
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.

1731
01:25:50,088 --> 01:25:51,508
Fucking fascist!

1732
01:25:53,057 --> 01:25:55,057
Stay out of Malibu,
Lebowski!

1733
01:25:56,146 --> 01:25:59,015
Stay out of Malibu,
deadbeat!

1734
01:25:59,055 --> 01:26:01,564
Keep your ugly fucking
gold-bricking ass

1735
01:26:01,604 --> 01:26:04,443
out of
my beach community.

1736
01:26:04,483 --> 01:26:10,951
# I want to sleep with you
in the desert tonight #

1737
01:26:10,991 --> 01:26:15,990
# With a billion stars
all around #

1738
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,489
Jesus...

1739
01:26:17,539 --> 01:26:20,048
Man, could you
change the channel?

1740
01:26:20,088 --> 01:26:22,128
Fuck you, man!
if you don't like my music,

1741
01:26:22,168 --> 01:26:23,047
get your own fucking cab!

1742
01:26:23,087 --> 01:26:24,547
I had a really rough

1743
01:26:24,587 --> 01:26:26,586
I'll pull over
and kiss your ass out.

1744
01:26:26,626 --> 01:26:28,515
Man, come on,
I had a rough night,

1745
01:26:28,515 --> 01:26:32,214
And I hate
the fucking eagles, man.

1746
01:26:38,472 --> 01:26:39,982
Out of my fucking cab!

1747
01:27:02,084 --> 01:27:04,004
# Devil-may-care #

1748
01:27:04,004 --> 01:27:07,462
# And I'm the devil
with love to spare #

1749
01:27:07,462 --> 01:27:12,131
# So viva, Las Vegas #

1750
01:27:12,221 --> 01:27:15,690
# Viva, Las Vegas #

1751
01:27:49,708 --> 01:27:51,228
Jeffrey.

1752
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:53,727
Maude?

1753
01:27:53,767 --> 01:27:55,226
Love me.

1754
01:27:56,666 --> 01:27:59,145
Uh, that's my robe.

1755
01:27:59,195 --> 01:28:02,974
Tell me about
yourself, Jeffrey.

1756
01:28:03,104 --> 01:28:05,403
Well, not much
to tell.

1757
01:28:05,443 --> 01:28:10,531
I, um, I was one
of the authors

1758
01:28:10,571 --> 01:28:13,530
of the port Huron
Statement.

1759
01:28:13,570 --> 01:28:15,440
The original
Port Huron Statement.

1760
01:28:16,479 --> 01:28:20,658
Not the compromised
second draft.

1761
01:28:22,127 --> 01:28:24,996
Uh, and then I,

1762
01:28:24,996 --> 01:28:26,516
you ever hear
of the Seattle 7?

1763
01:28:27,596 --> 01:28:30,515
That was me.

1764
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:35,013
And, um,
the 6 other guys.

1765
01:28:35,053 --> 01:28:39,062
Um, and then
a music business briefly.

1766
01:28:40,101 --> 01:28:42,521
Yeah, a roadie
for Metallica.

1767
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:45,609
Speed of sound tour.

1768
01:28:47,569 --> 01:28:50,118
Bunch of assholes.

1769
01:28:50,198 --> 01:28:51,977
Uh, and then,
you know,

1770
01:28:51,977 --> 01:28:55,036
A little of this,
a little of that.

1771
01:28:55,066 --> 01:28:58,455
My career's slowed down
a little lately.

1772
01:28:58,535 --> 01:29:02,584
What do you do
for recreation?

1773
01:29:02,624 --> 01:29:08,092
Oh, the usual.
Bowl, drive around.

1774
01:29:08,092 --> 01:29:11,211
The occasional
acid flashback.

1775
01:29:17,049 --> 01:29:19,478
What happened
to your house?

1776
01:29:19,478 --> 01:29:21,567
Oh, Jackie Treehorn
trashed the place.

1777
01:29:21,567 --> 01:29:24,446
He thought I had
your father's money.

1778
01:29:24,526 --> 01:29:27,565
He got me out of the way
while he looked for it.

1779
01:29:27,655 --> 01:29:28,605
Cocktail?

1780
01:29:28,695 --> 01:29:30,035
No, thanks.

1781
01:29:30,165 --> 01:29:31,654
It's not my
father's money.

1782
01:29:31,654 --> 01:29:33,623
It's the
Foundation's.

1783
01:29:33,623 --> 01:29:35,623
Why did he think
you have it?

1784
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:37,202
And who does?

1785
01:29:37,202 --> 01:29:40,091
Oh, Larry Sellers,
this high school kid.

1786
01:29:40,171 --> 01:29:41,591
Real fucking brat.

1787
01:29:41,591 --> 01:29:45,090
You know, this is a very
complicated case, Maude.

1788
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:47,999
Lotta ins, lotta outs.

1789
01:29:48,099 --> 01:29:49,008
You know, fortunately,

1790
01:29:49,008 --> 01:29:51,377
I'm adhering to
a pretty strict,

1791
01:29:51,457 --> 01:29:53,927
drug regiment to keep
my mind, you know,

1792
01:29:54,017 --> 01:29:56,016
Uh, limber, you know.

1793
01:29:56,096 --> 01:29:58,645
Very fucking close
to your father's money.

1794
01:29:58,645 --> 01:30:01,144
I keep telling you it's
the Foundation's money.

1795
01:30:01,184 --> 01:30:02,694
Father doesn't have any.

1796
01:30:04,643 --> 01:30:06,612
What are you talking about?
he's fucking loaded.

1797
01:30:06,612 --> 01:30:09,531
No, no, the wealth
was all mother's.

1798
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:11,611
No, he runs stuff,

1799
01:30:11,661 --> 01:30:14,240
We did let him run one
of the companies briefly,

1800
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:15,539
But he didn't do
very well at it.

1801
01:30:15,579 --> 01:30:17,169
No, he's, you know.

1802
01:30:17,209 --> 01:30:18,488
No, he helps administer
the charities now,

1803
01:30:18,528 --> 01:30:22,037
and I give him
a reasonable allowance.

1804
01:30:22,087 --> 01:30:23,627
He has no money
of his own.

1805
01:30:23,627 --> 01:30:25,556
I know how he likes
to present himself.

1806
01:30:25,596 --> 01:30:27,635
Father's weakness
is vanity.

1807
01:30:27,675 --> 01:30:28,635
Hence, the slut.

1808
01:30:28,675 --> 01:30:34,103
Uh, do you think he,

1809
01:30:34,133 --> 01:30:35,563
What is that, yoga?

1810
01:30:35,603 --> 01:30:38,102
It increases the chances
of conception.

1811
01:30:41,141 --> 01:30:42,100
Increases?

1812
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:43,450
Well, yes.

1813
01:30:43,490 --> 01:30:45,029
What did you think
this was all about?

1814
01:30:45,029 --> 01:30:45,989
Fun and games?

1815
01:30:46,029 --> 01:30:49,068
I want a child.

1816
01:30:49,108 --> 01:30:51,487
Ok, yeah, ok,
but let me

1817
01:30:51,527 --> 01:30:53,577
Let me explain
something about The Dude.

1818
01:30:53,617 --> 01:30:55,626
Uh, look, Jeffrey,

1819
01:30:55,666 --> 01:30:57,115
I don't want
a partner.

1820
01:30:57,155 --> 01:30:59,195
In fact, I don't
want the father

1821
01:30:59,235 --> 01:31:01,214
to be someone
I have to see socially

1822
01:31:01,244 --> 01:31:02,674
or who'll have
any interest

1823
01:31:02,714 --> 01:31:04,293
in raising
the child himself.

1824
01:31:04,343 --> 01:31:08,052
Oh, so that doctor

1825
01:31:08,172 --> 01:31:13,560
Exactly. Now, what
happened to your face?

1826
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:15,519
Did Jackie Treehorn
Do that as well?

1827
01:31:15,559 --> 01:31:19,568
No, it was the chief
of police of Malibu.

1828
01:31:19,648 --> 01:31:21,147
A real reactionary.

1829
01:31:21,147 --> 01:31:25,196
So, your father...

1830
01:31:25,276 --> 01:31:27,145
Oh, yeah, I get it.

1831
01:31:28,285 --> 01:31:30,744
Oh, man, my thinking
about this case

1832
01:31:30,824 --> 01:31:35,283
had become very uptight.
Yeah, your father.

1833
01:31:36,662 --> 01:31:39,331
Jeffrey, what are
you talking about?

1834
01:31:42,170 --> 01:31:43,710
Walter, if you're there,

1835
01:31:43,710 --> 01:31:47,599
pick up the fucking phone,
man, come on, Walter.

1836
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:49,638
Pick it up, man,
this is an emergency.

1837
01:31:49,638 --> 01:31:50,678
Come on, enough--Dude?

1838
01:31:50,678 --> 01:31:53,137
Yeah, listen, Walter,
I'm at my place.

1839
01:31:53,217 --> 01:31:54,596
I need you to come
pick me up.

1840
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:56,226
I can't drive, Dude,
It's erev Shabbos.

1841
01:31:56,226 --> 01:31:59,684
What?
Erev Shabbos.

1842
01:31:59,774 --> 01:32:02,234
I can't drive.
Man!

1843
01:32:02,314 --> 01:32:03,183
I'm not even supposed
to pick up the phone

1844
01:32:03,233 --> 01:32:04,693
unless it's
an emergency.

1845
01:32:04,743 --> 01:32:07,112
This is
a fucking emergency.

1846
01:32:07,152 --> 01:32:09,651
I understand. That's why
I picked up the phone.

1847
01:32:09,651 --> 01:32:11,071
Walter, you fuck,

1848
01:32:11,111 --> 01:32:13,070
we gotta go
to Pasadena, man.

1849
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:15,919
Come pick me up or I’m off
the fucking bowling team.

1850
01:32:31,384 --> 01:32:34,143
Get out of that
fucking car, man.

1851
01:32:34,723 --> 01:32:37,222
Get out of that
fucking car!

1852
01:32:37,272 --> 01:32:40,351
Get the fuck out
of the car, man.

1853
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:43,820
Get out of
the fucking

1854
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:45,279
Who the fuck
are you, man?

1855
01:32:45,319 --> 01:32:48,278
Easy, man.
Relax, man.

1856
01:32:48,358 --> 01:32:50,328
No physical harm
intended.

1857
01:32:50,368 --> 01:32:51,367
Who the fuck
are you?

1858
01:32:51,407 --> 01:32:52,827
Why are you
following me around?

1859
01:32:52,867 --> 01:32:54,366
Come on, fuckhead.

1860
01:32:54,366 --> 01:32:56,865
Relax, man.
I'm a brother Seamus.

1861
01:32:56,915 --> 01:32:58,415
Brother Seamus?

1862
01:33:00,504 --> 01:33:01,834
Like an Irish monk?

1863
01:33:01,884 --> 01:33:03,753
What the fuck are you
talking about?

1864
01:33:03,753 --> 01:33:05,293
My name is Da Fino.

1865
01:33:05,382 --> 01:33:08,391
I'm a private snoop,
like you, man.

1866
01:33:10,261 --> 01:33:11,101
A dick, man.

1867
01:33:11,181 --> 01:33:14,809
And let me tell you
something. I dig your work.

1868
01:33:14,809 --> 01:33:16,349
Playing one side
against the other.

1869
01:33:16,429 --> 01:33:18,858
In bed with everybody.
Fabulous stuff, man.

1870
01:33:18,938 --> 01:33:20,817
I'm not... fuck it, man.

1871
01:33:20,897 --> 01:33:23,316
Just stay away from
my fucking lady friend.

1872
01:33:23,396 --> 01:33:25,856
Hey, hey, I’m not messing
with your special lady.

1873
01:33:25,896 --> 01:33:27,325
She's not
my special lady.

1874
01:33:27,325 --> 01:33:28,365
She's my fucking
lady friend.

1875
01:33:28,365 --> 01:33:30,324
I'm just helping
her conceive, man.

1876
01:33:30,404 --> 01:33:31,244
Hey, man, I'm not

1877
01:33:31,324 --> 01:33:32,243
Who are you
working for?

1878
01:33:32,243 --> 01:33:33,783
Lebowski?

1879
01:33:33,863 --> 01:33:35,962
Jackie Treehorn?

1880
01:33:36,872 --> 01:33:38,251
The Knutsens.

1881
01:33:38,331 --> 01:33:42,710
The--who the fuck
are the Knutsens?

1882
01:33:42,830 --> 01:33:46,719
The Knutsen's. It's
a wandering daughter job.

1883
01:33:47,758 --> 01:33:50,297
Bunny Lebowski, man.

1884
01:33:50,297 --> 01:33:53,176
Her real name
is Fawn Knutsen.

1885
01:33:53,266 --> 01:33:55,816
Her parents want her back.

1886
01:33:55,816 --> 01:33:58,225
Jesus fucking Christ.

1887
01:33:58,225 --> 01:34:01,064
Crazy, huh? Ran away
about a year ago.

1888
01:34:01,184 --> 01:34:03,573
The Knutsens told me
I should show her this

1889
01:34:03,613 --> 01:34:04,613
when I found her.

1890
01:34:04,653 --> 01:34:06,192
It's the family farm.

1891
01:34:06,282 --> 01:34:08,691
It's outside of
Moorhead, Minnesota.

1892
01:34:08,781 --> 01:34:10,151
They think it'll
make her homesick.

1893
01:34:10,241 --> 01:34:12,120
Oh, boy.
How are you gonna

1894
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:13,160
keep 'em
down on the farm

1895
01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:16,289
once they've seen
Karl Hungus?

1896
01:34:16,369 --> 01:34:17,788
She's been
kidnapped, Da Fino.

1897
01:34:18,918 --> 01:34:19,788
Oh, I don't know.
maybe not,

1898
01:34:19,828 --> 01:34:21,837
But she's definitely
not around.

1899
01:34:21,927 --> 01:34:26,085
Hey, maybe you and me
could pool our resources.

1900
01:34:26,255 --> 01:34:30,184
Trade information.
Professional courtesy.

1901
01:34:30,264 --> 01:34:31,804
Compeers, you know
what I mean?

1902
01:34:31,804 --> 01:34:34,263
I get it.
Fuck off, Da Fino.

1903
01:34:34,303 --> 01:34:36,222
And stay away
from my special

1904
01:34:36,262 --> 01:34:39,981
From my fucking
lady friend, man.

1905
01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:44,319
Ze lingonberry
pancakes.

1906
01:34:48,368 --> 01:34:50,407
Lingonberry pancakes.

1907
01:34:53,826 --> 01:34:56,825
Sree pigs in blanket.

1908
01:35:01,754 --> 01:35:03,833
She has lingonberry
pancakes.

1909
01:35:12,220 --> 01:35:14,849
I mean we totally
fucked it up, man.

1910
01:35:14,889 --> 01:35:15,769
We fucked up his payoff,

1911
01:35:15,809 --> 01:35:18,268
we got the kidnappers
all pissed off,

1912
01:35:18,268 --> 01:35:20,227
And Lebowski, you know,
he yelled at me a lot,

1913
01:35:20,267 --> 01:35:22,187
But he didn't
do anything?

1914
01:35:22,267 --> 01:35:24,236
Well, sometimes
it's a cathartic

1915
01:35:24,276 --> 01:35:27,235
No, no, I'm saying if
he knows I’m a fuck-up,

1916
01:35:27,235 --> 01:35:28,155
why does he
leave me in charge

1917
01:35:28,235 --> 01:35:29,784
Of getting his wife back?

1918
01:35:29,784 --> 01:35:33,203
Because he doesn't fucking
want her back, man.

1919
01:35:33,203 --> 01:35:35,292
He's had enough.
He no longer digs her.

1920
01:35:35,292 --> 01:35:36,752
It's all a show.

1921
01:35:36,792 --> 01:35:39,211
Ok, but then, why
doesn't he give a shit

1922
01:35:39,291 --> 01:35:40,790
About his million bucks?

1923
01:35:40,790 --> 01:35:43,679
I mean, he knows we never
handed off his briefcase,

1924
01:35:43,759 --> 01:35:46,339
but he never asked
for it back.

1925
01:35:46,339 --> 01:35:49,757
The million bucks was
never in the briefcase.

1926
01:35:49,757 --> 01:35:53,016
The briefcase was
fucking empty, man.

1927
01:35:53,016 --> 01:35:56,015
The asshole was hoping
that they would kill her.

1928
01:35:56,015 --> 01:35:58,554
You threw out a ringer
for a ringer.

1929
01:35:58,554 --> 01:35:59,934
Ok, but how does
this all add up

1930
01:36:00,014 --> 01:36:02,023
To an emergency?

1931
01:36:02,113 --> 01:36:04,862
I'm saying I see what
you're getting at, Dude,

1932
01:36:04,942 --> 01:36:06,482
He kept the money.

1933
01:36:06,482 --> 01:36:07,861
My point is,

1934
01:36:07,941 --> 01:36:10,371
here we are,
it's Shabbos,

1935
01:36:10,490 --> 01:36:12,450
the Sabbath, which
I'm allowed to break

1936
01:36:12,580 --> 01:36:15,409
only if it's a matter
of life or death.

1937
01:36:15,409 --> 01:36:16,948
Will you come off it,
Walter?

1938
01:36:17,038 --> 01:36:18,288
You're not even
fucking Jewish, man.

1939
01:36:18,368 --> 01:36:20,837
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1940
01:36:20,917 --> 01:36:22,416
You're fucking
Polish-catholic.

1941
01:36:22,416 --> 01:36:23,966
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1942
01:36:24,046 --> 01:36:25,545
I converted when
I married Cynthia.

1943
01:36:25,545 --> 01:36:27,005
Come on, Dude.
Yeah, yeah.

1944
01:36:27,045 --> 01:36:28,514
You know this.

1945
01:36:28,554 --> 01:36:30,514
And 5 fucking years ago,
you were divorced.

1946
01:36:30,594 --> 01:36:31,973
So what are saying?
When you get divorced,

1947
01:36:32,013 --> 01:36:33,553
You turn in
your library card?

1948
01:36:33,593 --> 01:36:36,052
You get a new license?
You stop being Jewish?

1949
01:36:36,142 --> 01:36:37,481
This is
the driveway, huh?

1950
01:36:37,521 --> 01:36:39,111
I'm Jewish as
fucking Tevye.

1951
01:36:39,151 --> 01:36:41,560
Man, you know,
it's all a part

1952
01:36:41,650 --> 01:36:44,229
of your sick
Cynthia thing.

1953
01:36:44,229 --> 01:36:46,079
Man, taking care
of her fucking dog.

1954
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:48,028
Going to her
fucking synagogue.

1955
01:36:48,078 --> 01:36:49,987
You're living in
the fucking past.

1956
01:36:50,037 --> 01:36:51,617
3,000 years of
beautiful tradition

1957
01:36:51,657 --> 01:36:53,616
from Moses
to Sandy Koufax,

1958
01:36:53,616 --> 01:36:54,656
you're goddamn right

1959
01:36:54,656 --> 01:36:56,585
I'm living in
the fucking past!

1960
01:36:59,004 --> 01:37:02,663
What the hell
happened?

1961
01:37:21,307 --> 01:37:22,866
Where was she, man?

1962
01:37:22,946 --> 01:37:24,326
Visiting friends of hers
in Palm Springs.

1963
01:37:24,366 --> 01:37:25,945
She just picked up
and left.

1964
01:37:25,985 --> 01:37:27,325
Never bothered
to tell us.

1965
01:37:27,405 --> 01:37:29,824
Well, I guess the fucking
nihilist knew where she was.

1966
01:37:29,904 --> 01:37:32,373
Jesus, Dude, she never
even kidnapped herself.

1967
01:37:32,373 --> 01:37:33,873
Who is this gentleman,
Dude?

1968
01:37:33,993 --> 01:37:35,912
Who am I? I'm
a fucking veteran.

1969
01:37:35,912 --> 01:37:37,871
He shouldn't go
in there, Dude.

1970
01:37:37,911 --> 01:37:39,371
He's very angry.

1971
01:37:42,010 --> 01:37:42,800
Hello, man.

1972
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:47,418
So, she's back,
no thanks to you.

1973
01:37:47,418 --> 01:37:49,377
Where's the fucking
money, Lebowski?

1974
01:37:49,377 --> 01:37:51,347
A million bucks
from fucking needy

1975
01:37:51,437 --> 01:37:52,936
Little urban
achievers!

1976
01:37:52,936 --> 01:37:54,346
You are scum, man!

1977
01:37:54,436 --> 01:37:55,805
Who the hell is he?

1978
01:37:55,895 --> 01:37:56,845
Who am I? Who am I?

1979
01:37:56,935 --> 01:37:57,845
I'm the guy
that's gonna kick

1980
01:37:57,974 --> 01:37:59,854
Your phony goldbricking
ass! That's who I am.

1981
01:37:59,904 --> 01:38:01,903
Man, we know the briefcase
was fucking empty.

1982
01:38:01,903 --> 01:38:03,863
We know you kept the million
bucks for yourself.

1983
01:38:03,942 --> 01:38:05,442
You have your story,
I have mine.

1984
01:38:05,442 --> 01:38:07,911
I say I entrusted
the money to you,

1985
01:38:07,991 --> 01:38:08,911
And you stole it.

1986
01:38:08,911 --> 01:38:10,870
As if we would ever
dream of taking

1987
01:38:10,870 --> 01:38:12,330
your bullshit
money!

1988
01:38:12,330 --> 01:38:14,789
You thought that Bunny
had been kidnapped,

1989
01:38:14,869 --> 01:38:16,368
and you were
fucking glad, man.

1990
01:38:16,368 --> 01:38:18,458
You could use it as an excuse
to make some money disappear.

1991
01:38:18,458 --> 01:38:20,417
All you needed was a sap
to pin it on.

1992
01:38:20,507 --> 01:38:24,915
You just met me.
You human paraquat!

1993
01:38:24,965 --> 01:38:27,305
You figured, oh,
here's a loser, you know.

1994
01:38:27,385 --> 01:38:29,804
A deadbeat.
somebody the square community

1995
01:38:29,884 --> 01:38:30,843
Won't give a shit about.

1996
01:38:30,933 --> 01:38:33,093
Well, aren't you?

1997
01:38:33,932 --> 01:38:36,941
Well, yeah, but

1998
01:38:36,941 --> 01:38:38,311
Get out, both of you.

1999
01:38:38,311 --> 01:38:39,351
Look at that
fucking phoney, Dude.

2000
01:38:39,351 --> 01:38:41,270
Pretending to be a
fucking millionaire.

2001
01:38:41,310 --> 01:38:43,809
Out of this house now,
you bums!

2002
01:38:43,809 --> 01:38:45,319
Let me tell you
something else.

2003
01:38:45,449 --> 01:38:47,828
I've seen a lot of
spinals, Dude,

2004
01:38:47,868 --> 01:38:49,827
And this guy's
a fake.

2005
01:38:49,907 --> 01:38:51,237
A fucking
goldbricker.

2006
01:38:51,277 --> 01:38:52,866
Stay away from me,
mister!

2007
01:38:52,906 --> 01:38:54,835
This guy
fucking walks.

2008
01:38:54,875 --> 01:38:55,995
I've never been
more certain

2009
01:38:56,045 --> 01:38:57,495
of anything
in my life.

2010
01:38:57,545 --> 01:38:58,334
You stay away from me!

2011
01:38:58,414 --> 01:39:00,913
Walter, for Christ's sake,
man, he's a cripple.

2012
01:39:00,953 --> 01:39:02,423
Come on, come on.

2013
01:39:02,463 --> 01:39:03,463
Get away from me!

2014
01:39:05,552 --> 01:39:06,422
Put him down, man!

2015
01:39:06,472 --> 01:39:07,921
Yeah, I'll put
him down, Dude!

2016
01:39:07,971 --> 01:39:13,229
Rauss! Achtung, baby!

2017
01:39:27,485 --> 01:39:30,084
Come on, man, help me
put him back in his chair.

2018
01:39:49,927 --> 01:39:52,386
Sure, you'll see
some tank battles.

2019
01:39:52,386 --> 01:39:54,346
But fighting in desert
is very different

2020
01:39:54,435 --> 01:39:56,895
from fighting
in canopy jungle.

2021
01:39:56,945 --> 01:39:58,984
I mean 'nam was
a foot soldier's war.

2022
01:39:58,984 --> 01:40:02,273
Whereas, this thing
should, you know,

2023
01:40:02,353 --> 01:40:03,902
should be
a piece of cake.

2024
01:40:03,902 --> 01:40:05,352
I mean, I had
an M16, Jacko.

2025
01:40:05,352 --> 01:40:07,321
Not an Abrams
fucking tank.

2026
01:40:07,321 --> 01:40:09,910
Me and Charlie,
eyeball to eyeball.

2027
01:40:09,990 --> 01:40:10,910
Yeah.

2028
01:40:10,910 --> 01:40:13,409
That's fuckin' combat.

2029
01:40:13,529 --> 01:40:15,998
The man in the
black pajamas, Dude.

2030
01:40:15,998 --> 01:40:17,958
Worthy fuckin'
adversary.

2031
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:18,997
Who's in
pajamas, Walter?

2032
01:40:19,087 --> 01:40:21,496
Shut the fuck up,
Donny.

2033
01:40:21,496 --> 01:40:24,056
Whereas, what we
have here...

2034
01:40:24,056 --> 01:40:25,925
Lots of fig-eaters wearing
towels on their heads,

2035
01:40:25,925 --> 01:40:28,014
trying to find reverse
on a soviet tank.

2036
01:40:28,014 --> 01:40:29,974
This... is not
a worthy

2037
01:40:29,974 --> 01:40:31,013
Hey!

2038
01:40:31,013 --> 01:40:33,432
What's this
day of rest shit?

2039
01:40:33,432 --> 01:40:35,392
What's this bullshit!

2040
01:40:35,392 --> 01:40:36,851
I don't fuckin' care!

2041
01:40:36,851 --> 01:40:38,391
It don't matter
to Jesus.

2042
01:40:38,441 --> 01:40:39,980
But you not
fooling me, man.

2043
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:42,489
You might fool the fucks
in the league office,

2044
01:40:42,529 --> 01:40:44,949
but you don't
fool Jesus.

2045
01:40:45,029 --> 01:40:47,988
It's bush league
psyche-out stuff.

2046
01:40:48,028 --> 01:40:50,407
Laughable, man. Ha ha!

2047
01:40:50,567 --> 01:40:54,535
I would have fucked you
in the ass Saturday.

2048
01:40:54,585 --> 01:40:57,874
I'll fuck you in the ass
Next Wednesday instead.

2049
01:40:57,914 --> 01:41:01,593
Whoo! You got a date
Wednesday, baby.

2050
01:41:05,962 --> 01:41:07,881
He's cracking.

2051
01:41:07,921 --> 01:41:08,921
The whole concept of Asia.

2052
01:41:08,961 --> 01:41:11,430
I mean, many learned men
have disputed this,

2053
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:16,978
but in the 14th century.
the rabban, he…

2054
01:41:24,735 --> 01:41:26,525
Well, they
finally did it.

2055
01:41:26,605 --> 01:41:29,164
They killed
my fucking car.

2056
01:41:29,164 --> 01:41:32,623
We want some money,
Lebowski.

2057
01:41:32,623 --> 01:41:35,122
Ja, otherwise,
we kill the girl.

2058
01:41:35,162 --> 01:41:37,091
Ja, it seems
you have forgotten

2059
01:41:37,131 --> 01:41:38,751
Our little deal,
Lebowski.

2060
01:41:38,791 --> 01:41:41,840
You don't have the
fucking girl, dipshit.

2061
01:41:41,879 --> 01:41:44,249
We know you never did.

2062
01:41:44,299 --> 01:41:45,718
Are these the Nazis,
Walter?

2063
01:41:45,808 --> 01:41:47,348
No, Donny, these men
are nihilists.

2064
01:41:47,388 --> 01:41:48,807
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

2065
01:41:50,846 --> 01:41:53,805
Vee don't care. Vee
still want the money,

2066
01:41:53,805 --> 01:41:56,065
Lebowski, or
we'll fuck you up.

2067
01:41:56,105 --> 01:41:59,144
Fuck you.
Fuck the 3 of yous.

2068
01:41:59,194 --> 01:42:02,603
No, without a hostage,
there is no ransom.

2069
01:42:02,693 --> 01:42:04,112
That's what ransom is.

2070
01:42:04,152 --> 01:42:06,201
Those are the fucking rules.

2071
01:42:06,241 --> 01:42:08,281
His girlfriend
gave up her toe.

2072
01:42:08,321 --> 01:42:10,740
She zought we'd be
getting $1 million.

2073
01:42:10,740 --> 01:42:12,239
It's not fair.

2074
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:15,748
Fair? Who's the fucking
nihilist around here?

2075
01:42:15,828 --> 01:42:17,248
You bunch of
fucking cry-babies.

2076
01:42:17,338 --> 01:42:19,747
Cool it, Walter.
Hey, look, pal,

2077
01:42:19,747 --> 01:42:21,836
There never was
any money.

2078
01:42:21,836 --> 01:42:23,675
The big Lebowski gave
me an empty briefcase,

2079
01:42:23,715 --> 01:42:26,175
So take it up
with him, man.

2080
01:42:26,305 --> 01:42:28,714
Yeah, and I would like
my undies back.

2081
01:42:28,714 --> 01:42:29,763
Are these guys gonna
hurt us, Walter?

2082
01:42:29,763 --> 01:42:32,273
No, Donny, these
men are cowards.

2083
01:42:32,273 --> 01:42:35,731
Ok, so we take ze
money you haf on you

2084
01:42:35,731 --> 01:42:37,771
And we calls it
even.

2085
01:42:38,810 --> 01:42:39,770
Fuck you.

2086
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:41,240
Hey, no, come on,
Walter, come on.

2087
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:43,199
We're ending this
thing cheap, man.

2088
01:42:43,279 --> 01:42:44,239
No, what's mine is mine.

2089
01:42:44,319 --> 01:42:45,278
Oh, come on, Walter.

2090
01:42:45,358 --> 01:42:46,778
No funny stuff.

2091
01:42:46,778 --> 01:42:49,787
All right,
all right, I got,

2092
01:42:49,827 --> 01:42:52,746
Uh, 4 bucks,
almost 5.

2093
01:42:52,746 --> 01:42:53,575
I got $18.

2094
01:42:53,625 --> 01:42:55,665
What's
mine is mine.

2095
01:42:55,705 --> 01:42:58,674
We fuck you up, man.
We takes the money.

2096
01:42:58,834 --> 01:43:00,343
Come and get it.

2097
01:43:01,673 --> 01:43:04,212
We fuck you up.

2098
01:43:04,212 --> 01:43:06,301
Show me what
you got, nihilist.

2099
01:43:06,301 --> 01:43:07,721
I fuck you.

2100
01:43:07,761 --> 01:43:08,760
Walter, come on,
he's got a sword.

2101
01:43:08,810 --> 01:43:11,220
Fucking dipshit with
a 9-toed woman.

2102
01:43:11,350 --> 01:43:12,679
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

2103
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:15,848
I fuck you up!

2104
01:43:21,816 --> 01:43:22,646
Take it easy, man.

2105
01:43:22,686 --> 01:43:24,195
Here's the $4.00.

2106
01:43:29,284 --> 01:43:32,362
I got a fucking ball, man.

2107
01:43:37,921 --> 01:43:39,330
Anti-Semite!

2108
01:43:39,330 --> 01:43:41,289
I fuck you in ze ass.

2109
01:43:41,339 --> 01:43:42,789
I fuck you
in ze ass.

2110
01:43:42,839 --> 01:43:48,507
I fuck you!
I fuck you!

2111
01:43:54,275 --> 01:43:56,274
We got a man down, Dude.

2112
01:43:59,813 --> 01:44:01,863
God, they shot him,
man.

2113
01:44:01,903 --> 01:44:02,782
No, Dude.

2114
01:44:02,782 --> 01:44:03,822
They shot Donny?

2115
01:44:03,822 --> 01:44:04,742
There weren't
any shots fired.

2116
01:44:04,782 --> 01:44:06,821
It's a heart attack.

2117
01:44:06,861 --> 01:44:09,360
Call the medics, Dude.

2118
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:12,369
I'd go myself, but I’m
pumping blood. Might pass out.

2119
01:44:12,419 --> 01:44:16,248
Rest easy, good buddy,
you're doing fine.

2120
01:44:16,248 --> 01:44:18,327
We got help
choppering in.

2121
01:44:45,778 --> 01:44:48,707
Hello, gentlemen.
You are the bereaved?

2122
01:44:48,707 --> 01:44:50,246
Yeah, man.

2123
01:44:50,246 --> 01:44:52,746
Francis Donnelly.
Pleased to meet you.

2124
01:44:52,746 --> 01:44:54,285
Jeff Lebowski.

2125
01:44:54,365 --> 01:44:55,745
Walter Sobchak.

2126
01:44:55,745 --> 01:44:58,754
The Dude, actually,
is,

2127
01:44:58,834 --> 01:44:59,793
Excuse me?

2128
01:44:59,883 --> 01:45:01,293
Oh, nothing.

2129
01:45:01,293 --> 01:45:07,351
Yes, I understand you're
taking away the remains.

2130
01:45:09,350 --> 01:45:12,179
We have the urn.

2131
01:45:12,309 --> 01:45:15,438
I assume this is
credit card.

2132
01:45:31,862 --> 01:45:32,752
What's this?

2133
01:45:32,792 --> 01:45:35,831
That's for the urn.

2134
01:45:35,871 --> 01:45:38,210
Don't need it. We're
Scattering the ashes.

2135
01:45:38,210 --> 01:45:41,329
Yes, so we
Were informed.

2136
01:45:41,379 --> 01:45:42,389
However, we must,
Of course,

2137
01:45:42,389 --> 01:45:46,468
Transmit the remains
To you in a receptacle.

2138
01:45:47,967 --> 01:45:50,006
This is $180.

2139
01:45:50,046 --> 01:45:53,855
It is our most modestly
priced receptacle.

2140
01:45:53,975 --> 01:45:56,434
Can we just... $180?

2141
01:45:56,434 --> 01:45:58,394
They range up to 3,000.

2142
01:46:00,533 --> 01:46:02,532
Can't we just
rent it from you?

2143
01:46:02,572 --> 01:46:05,531
Sir, this is a mortuary,
not a rental house.

2144
01:46:05,571 --> 01:46:07,321
We're scattering
the fucking ashes!

2145
01:46:07,361 --> 01:46:08,820
Look, just because
we're bereaved,

2146
01:46:08,860 --> 01:46:09,870
Doesn't
make us saps!

2147
01:46:09,910 --> 01:46:12,869
Sir, please,
lower your voices.

2148
01:46:12,959 --> 01:46:14,368
Man, don't you have,
you know,

2149
01:46:14,408 --> 01:46:18,377
Something else we could
put him in, you know?

2150
01:46:18,507 --> 01:46:21,466
That is our most modestly
priced receptacle.

2151
01:46:21,466 --> 01:46:22,505
God damn it!

2152
01:46:25,465 --> 01:46:27,594
Is there a Ralph’s
around here?

2153
01:46:53,995 --> 01:46:55,504
Donny was
a good bowler

2154
01:46:55,504 --> 01:46:57,914
And a good man.

2155
01:46:57,964 --> 01:46:59,963
He was one of us.

2156
01:46:59,963 --> 01:47:03,722
He was a man who loved
the outdoors and bowling.

2157
01:47:03,842 --> 01:47:05,801
And as a surfer,
he explored the beaches

2158
01:47:05,931 --> 01:47:07,890
of Southern California,

2159
01:47:07,890 --> 01:47:11,009
from La Jolla
to Leo Carrillo

2160
01:47:11,009 --> 01:47:13,978
and up to Pismo.

2161
01:47:14,018 --> 01:47:19,017
He died...as so
many men of his generation,

2162
01:47:19,067 --> 01:47:20,396
Before his time.

2163
01:47:20,566 --> 01:47:23,985
In your wisdom, Lord,
you took him.

2164
01:47:24,035 --> 01:47:27,574
As you took so many bright,
flowering young men

2165
01:47:27,574 --> 01:47:29,943
at Khe Sanh, at Lan Doc,

2166
01:47:29,993 --> 01:47:33,372
and Hill 364.

2167
01:47:33,412 --> 01:47:35,961
These young men
gave their lives.

2168
01:47:35,961 --> 01:47:39,970
So did Donny.

2169
01:47:40,010 --> 01:47:42,049
Donny who loved bowling.

2170
01:47:45,048 --> 01:47:50,976
And so, Theodore
Donald Karabatsos,

2171
01:47:51,016 --> 01:47:53,935
in accordance with
what we think

2172
01:47:53,975 --> 01:47:57,514
your dying wishes
might well have been,

2173
01:47:57,554 --> 01:48:01,442
We commit your final
mortal remains

2174
01:48:01,482 --> 01:48:05,441
To the bosom
of the pacific ocean,

2175
01:48:05,441 --> 01:48:07,580
which you loved so well.

2176
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:11,619
Good night, sweet prince.

2177
01:48:30,053 --> 01:48:31,552
Oh, shit, Dude,
I'm sorry.

2178
01:48:34,051 --> 01:48:35,021
God damn wind.

2179
01:48:37,060 --> 01:48:38,560
You fucking asshole!

2180
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:41,519
Everything's a fucking
travesty with you, man.

2181
01:48:41,519 --> 01:48:43,618
I'm sorry.
It was an accident.

2182
01:48:43,618 --> 01:48:45,578
What was that shit
About Vietnam?

2183
01:48:45,578 --> 01:48:47,537
What the fuck
does anything

2184
01:48:47,617 --> 01:48:49,156
have to do
with Vietnam?

2185
01:48:49,156 --> 01:48:50,536
What the fuck are
you talking about?

2186
01:49:06,591 --> 01:49:11,229
Come on, Dude.
Hey, fuck it, man.

2187
01:49:14,648 --> 01:49:16,147
Let's go bowling.

2188
01:49:39,550 --> 01:49:43,548
And when you're
sitting there

2189
01:49:43,588 --> 01:49:48,057
in your silk
upholstered chair

2190
01:49:48,057 --> 01:49:53,305
talkin' to some rich folks
that you know

2191
01:49:55,514 --> 01:49:59,653
well, I hope
you don't see me

2192
01:49:59,693 --> 01:50:03,561
in my ragged company

2193
01:50:03,611 --> 01:50:09,240
Aw, that you know
I could never be alone

2194
01:50:10,789 --> 01:50:12,788
2 oat sodas, Gary.

2195
01:50:12,828 --> 01:50:13,698
Good luck tomorrow.

2196
01:50:13,698 --> 01:50:15,208
Yeah, thanks, man.

2197
01:50:15,298 --> 01:50:17,257
I'm sorry to hear
about Donny.

2198
01:50:17,297 --> 01:50:20,666
Oh, well, yeah,
you know,

2199
01:50:20,706 --> 01:50:22,165
Sometimes you
eat the bar,

2200
01:50:22,215 --> 01:50:25,174
And sometimes,
you know

2201
01:50:28,763 --> 01:50:30,682
I wondered if I'd
see you again.

2202
01:50:30,682 --> 01:50:32,642
I wouldn't
miss the semis?

2203
01:50:32,692 --> 01:50:34,271
How have things
been going?

2204
01:50:34,311 --> 01:50:36,231
Oh, you know,
strikes and gutters,

2205
01:50:36,231 --> 01:50:37,690
ups and downs.

2206
01:50:39,270 --> 01:50:42,658
Yeah. Thanks, Gary.

2207
01:50:42,738 --> 01:50:45,317
Well, take care, man.
Gotta get back.

2208
01:50:48,157 --> 01:50:50,586
I know that you will.

2209
01:50:50,666 --> 01:50:54,834
Yeah, well,
The Dude abides.

2210
01:51:00,842 --> 01:51:03,921
The Dude abides.

2211
01:51:06,670 --> 01:51:11,269
I don't know about you,
but I take comfort in that.

2212
01:51:11,269 --> 01:51:15,137
It's good knowing he's
out there, The Dude.

2213
01:51:15,137 --> 01:51:18,606
Takin' her easy
for all us sinners.

2214
01:51:18,696 --> 01:51:24,154
Shoosh. I sure hope
he makes the finals.

2215
01:51:24,234 --> 01:51:26,194
Well, that about does her.

2216
01:51:26,194 --> 01:51:29,203
Wraps her all up.

2217
01:51:29,203 --> 01:51:31,162
Things seemed to have
worked out pretty good

2218
01:51:31,242 --> 01:51:33,621
for The Dude and Walter.

2219
01:51:33,661 --> 01:51:35,701
And it was
a pretty good story,

2220
01:51:35,741 --> 01:51:37,800
Don't you think?

2221
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:40,759
Made me laugh
to beat the band.

2222
01:51:40,799 --> 01:51:43,628
Parts, anyway.

2223
01:51:43,668 --> 01:51:47,227
I didn't like
seeing Donny go.

2224
01:51:47,227 --> 01:51:48,726
But then
I happen to know

2225
01:51:48,726 --> 01:51:53,685
That there's a little
Lebowski on the way.

2226
01:51:53,765 --> 01:51:56,314
I guess that's how the
whole darn human comedy

2227
01:51:56,314 --> 01:52:00,232
keeps perpetuating itself

2228
01:52:00,312 --> 01:52:02,732
down through
the generations.

2229
01:52:02,772 --> 01:52:04,321
westward in the wagons,

2230
01:52:04,371 --> 01:52:08,240
and across the sands
of time until we

2231
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:09,579
Oh, look at me.

2232
01:52:09,619 --> 01:52:12,668
I'm ramblin' again.

2233
01:52:12,708 --> 01:52:15,667
Well, I hope you folks
enjoyed yourselves.

2234
01:52:15,707 --> 01:52:19,246
Catch ya later
on down the trail.

2235
01:52:19,296 --> 01:52:21,205
Say, friend,
you got any more

2236
01:52:21,265 --> 01:52:23,345
of that good
Sarsaparilla?

2236
01:53:00,265 --> 01:54:00,345
