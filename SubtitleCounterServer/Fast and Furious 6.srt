4
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,307
Señor  O'Conner,  señor  O'Conner!

5
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,773
It's okay, you're just in time.

6
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,608
You're going to be a great father, Brian.

7
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,236
What makes you so sure?

8
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,405
Because I'll be there
to kick your ass if you ain't.

9
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,740
-Get in there.
-Go.

10
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:58,993
Brian.

11
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,789
Remember, the second
you go through those doors,

12
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,291
everything changes.

13
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,294
Our old life is done.

14
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,261
Let's go for a little ride.

15
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,788
-Special Agent Hobbs?
-Riley Hicks.

16
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,750
I read your file. Top of your class at FLETC.

17
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,251
Cairo, Tunis.

18
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,503
Youngest RSO ever in Afghanistan.

19
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,965
Hell, if you're half as good
as you are on paper,

20
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,800
we're going to get along just fine.

21
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,927
A Russian military caravan attacked,

22
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,180
satellite component stolen.

23
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,973
Cars just came out of nowhere.

24
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,142
Six hospitalized, a dozen vehicles destroyed.

25
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,853
All that in under 90 seconds, in and out.

26
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:12,979
This is world-class.

27
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,647
Job this good,
there's only one crew in the world

28
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:15,815
who could get this done.

29
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,860
How the hell did that get up there?

30
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,199
They caught one.

31
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,492
Where?

32
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,789
I got you five minutes with this guy.

33
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,375
I only need two.

34
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,845
I want your boss. Where's Shaw?

35
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,852
I ain't telling you shit.

36
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,355
I was hoping
you'd say that.

37
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,904
Is that legal?

38
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,030
No.

39
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,701
But are you going to go
in there and tell him?

40
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,709
I've got rights,
you asshole!

41
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,711
Not today.

42
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,593
No, no!

43
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,354
-Well, is he talking?
-Not anymore.

44
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:37,522
That room is
bugged, Hobbs.

45
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,899
So, any information
you just beat out of him, Interpol has now.

46
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,902
Great. Now they can take the morning off.
Shaw's in London.

47
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,112
Let's go pick him up.

48
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,865
Woman, you just
don't pick up Owen Shaw like he's groceries.

49
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,409
If you want to
catch wolves, you need wolves.

50
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,202
Let's go hunting.

51
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,677
This is what
100 million buys?

52
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,639
It wasn't that hard
to find you, Toretto.

53
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,267
I wasn't hiding.

54
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,941
How's the life
of the retired international criminal?

55
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,486
I like it here.
It's quiet.

56
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,196
Nice weather,

57
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,657
and no extradition.

58
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,327
So what are you
doing here, cop?

59
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,871
Last Tuesday,
a team of highly coordinated drivers

60
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,499
took down an entire
military convoy in Russia.

61
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,126
I don't do cold weather.

62
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,293
I know it wasn't you.

63
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,046
But you're going to help me
catch the team responsible.

64
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,008
--And you ain't gonna need that.

65
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,886
You can't touch him, Hobbs.
You've got no powers...

66
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,222
I'm not here to
extradite anyone.

67
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,057
See, he's going to
come voluntarily.

68
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,851
As a matter of fact,

69
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,562
he's going to beg me.

70
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,524
This was taken a week ago.

71
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,737
I'll see you out front.

72
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,051
It's Letty, isn't it?

73
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,887
It's impossible.

74
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:22,729
If that was my husband,
if there was a chance, no matter how small,

75
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,441
I would go.

76
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,462
I'm going to need everything,
all the info you got.

77
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,255
You'll get it when
the team gets it.

78
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,757
No team.

79
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,760
This is going to
have to be me alone.

80
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,512
It's not that simple.

81
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,515
The crew we're after, they hit like
thunder and disappear like smoke.

82
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,142
You go in alone,
you won't ever touch them.

83
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,104
I've been chasing this guy
across four continents and 12 countries,

84
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,481
and believe me,
the last damn place I want to be right now

85
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,776
is on your front doorstep,
selling Girl Scout cookies.

86
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,946
I need your help, Dom.

87
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,117
I need your team.

88
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,330
Okay, ladies,
bring it in.

89
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,332
Listen,
I want to make a toast.

90
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,667
Come on.

91
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,130
Listen, I know a few of y'all
have already been to Macau,

92
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,965
but you have
never seen the town

93
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,174
till you've seen it
through my eyes.

94
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,010
We got a penthouse suite

95
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,803
with an ocean view that's
going to change your life.

96
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,764
150-foot yacht with
a helicopter pad...

97
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:43,435
Mmm-hmm. Safe to say,
you're about to have the time of your lives.

98
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,520
No, you are.

99
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,313
- Cheers.

100
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,321
Nice!

101
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,200
I'm a citizen of the world.

102
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,413
Ever thought about
settling down?

103
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,207
Starting a life together?

104
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,209
Aren't we doing that?

105
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,796
Are we?

106
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,072
Hello?

107
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,324
Dom?

108
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,577
I'll be there.

109
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,039
Hey, my man,
I need you to turn this plane around.

110
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,917
All right, listen, ladies.
There's been a little change of plans.

111
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,210
Something came up.

112
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,462
You know that casino
I was telling you all about?

113
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,464
I got some vouchers

114
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,924
to the buffet.

115
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,229
What do you
think of this?

116
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,816
-He likes it.
-All right.

117
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,401
Yes.

118
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,610
Or this?

119
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,738
Yes.

120
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,450
That's my boy.
All right, let's see how this thing flies.

121
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,744
Are you watching?

122
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,627
It's Uncle Dom.
What do you know?

123
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,963
Are you waving?
What up?

124
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,757
Hey, Jack.

125
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,259
What's up, Uncle Dom?
What's up, Uncle Dom?

126
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,136
You excited to see him?

127
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,971
Are you already
pushing imports on him?

128
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,140
You say, "Dad's not
pushing anything."

129
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,600
He chose that car.

130
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,310
We know
he's an O'Conner, but,

131
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,604
I brought you
something, Jack.

132
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,815
-Yeah! He's also a Toretto.
-I don't know.

133
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,651
Luckily, he has
a couple more years to decide, right?

134
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,612
I think he decided, Mia.

135
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,823
I think it's time
for his nap.

136
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,825
Come on, baby. Okay.

137
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,162
Say bye.

138
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,789
It's weird, huh?

139
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,958
What's weird?

140
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,295
We got everything.

141
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,465
You know, down to the beer
and the barbeque.

142
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,842
But it just...

143
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,637
I don't know,
it just doesn't feel like home.

144
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,640
Maybe it's because, uh,

145
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,101
you don't realize how much
you appreciate something

146
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,186
until somebody takes it away.

147
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,021
I don't know.

148
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,691
The place has probably
changed so much,

149
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,651
you wouldn't even recognize it anymore.

150
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,027
Yeah.

151
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,365
Everything's changed.

152
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,827
So what's up with you?
What's going on?

153
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:38,169
Taken a week ago.

154
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,839
Diplomatic Security Service.

155
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:42,674
Hobbs.

156
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,516
You know,
I used to do this shit all the time as a cop.

157
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:55,395
This is exactly what cops do.
He's messing with your head.

158
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,157
Letty's dead, Dom.

159
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,367
I need to know for sure.

160
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:12,871
Then I'm going with you.

161
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:14,372
You said you were going to
leave this life behind.

162
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,541
We both said that we were
leaving the life behind.

163
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,418
He's right.

164
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,253
We're family.

165
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,465
If we got a problem,
we deal with it together.

166
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,134
And I'll feel safer
knowing you're both out there,

167
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,428
watching each other's backs.

168
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:32,724
You're stronger together.
You always were.

169
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,102
Now go get Letty.

170
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,731
Bring her home.

171
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,834
Thank God!

172
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,920
Finally, some equipment
I can work with.

173
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,129
What up, boy?

174
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,923
This is way better
than that trash in Rio.

175
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,134
Way better.

176
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,640
You sure about these guys?

177
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,308
Nope.

178
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,978
Has anybody heard
from Leo or Santos?

179
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,816
Last time anyone saw them, they were hitting
up the casinos in Monte Carlo.

180
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,984
I thought that was
our last job, Brian.

181
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,696
And who's paying for all this equipment?
The taxpayers?

182
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:30,615
So now we work for The Hulk?
That's what we're doing?

183
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,576
Why do I smell baby oil?

184
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,120
If you keep
running your piehole,

185
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,496
you're going to
smell an ass-kicking.

186
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,706
All right, Hobbs,

187
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,541
you got the best
crew in the world

188
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,001
standing right
in front of you.

189
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,045
Give them a reason to stay.

190
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,008
Our target is Owen Shaw.

191
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,344
Former major in the S.A.S.,
Spec-ops soldier.

192
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,180
He ran the UK's Mobility Division
in Kabul and Basra.

193
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,017
Ah, damn.
That Mobility unit's the truth.

194
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:01,312
We're talking vehicular warfare.
Best in the world.

195
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,565
- You got some chips?
- Those guys don't mess around.

196
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,693
For years, they've been
running jobs in Europe,

197
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,153
but it's their
most recent jobs

198
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,488
that graduated them
to a whole new level.

199
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:13,033
Three targets,
highly specific.

200
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,702
The program terminal
from an ICBM missile...

201
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,996
Got a little change?

202
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,706
Seriously?
You're a millionaire,

203
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,708
and you're still
trying to ask for money?

204
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:25,712
That's how you
stay a millionaire.

205
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,047
So what does
this all mean?

206
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,715
Well, our best guess is
that Shaw's crew

207
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,842
is building
a Nightshade device.

208
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,677
-Which is?
-A tech bomb.

209
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:35,347
Designed to block
an entire military communication grid

210
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,723
for 24 hours.

211
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,558
If you blind a soldier
for a single second

212
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,268
in the middle of a fight,
he dies.

213
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,229
If you blind
a country for 24 hours,

214
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,689
the loss of life
is unthinkable.

215
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,734
This could be worth billions
to the right buyer.

216
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:48,860
Billions?

217
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,654
Why don't we just
steal that shit?

218
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:52,739
Hey, man.

219
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,325
Which one of these
things is a dollar?

220
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,202
It says something about...

221
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,166
It's on the house.

222
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,839
I want you to
help me catch Shaw.

223
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,384
He's only got
one piece left that he needs,

224
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,386
and I intend to stop him
before he gets it.

225
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,596
Now, I know
you guys are a family.

226
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:20,266
So I'm offering you
a chance right now

227
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,352
to make that
family whole again.

228
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,528
You want to make
this family whole again?

229
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,615
Get us to Letty,
we'll get you Shaw,

230
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,450
full pardons
all the way around.

231
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:42,706
I can't promise you that.

232
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,374
Yes, you can.

233
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,131
That's the deal.

234
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,633
Take it or leave it.

235
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,724
You get me Shaw,

236
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,768
and I'll get your pardons.

237
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:06,771
You heard him.

238
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,481
But this is different.

239
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:09,816
We're not
dealing with cops,

240
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,151
we're not dealing
with drug dealers.

241
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,362
This is a whole
different level.

242
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,409
We're getting paid,
right?

243
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,506
Interpol picked up
one of Shaw's guys in Moscow.

244
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,509
I went in, had a little
therapy session with him.

245
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,970
He gave up Shaw's hideout.

246
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:41,848
Then why aren't we
down there now?

247
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:43,850
Well, we weren't invited.

248
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,022
Hobbs, they're sending in
your punching bag.

249
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:53,026
He's wired. He's going to give a positive ID
on Shaw before they move in.

250
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:09,209
So, the cops just let you go, huh?

251
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:13,880
Don't worry,
I didn't give them shit.

252
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,049
Oh, I'm not worried.

253
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,134
Okay,

254
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,387
turn it over for me.

255
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,730
God, it's amazing.

256
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:35,276
The simplest things
can cause the biggest problems.

257
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:39,906
Good news is,
if you swap out a bad part,

258
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:44,327
everything runs
smooth as silk again.

259
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,248
Look, Shaw...

260
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,375
Wait, Shaw! Shaw!

261
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,085
Shaw!

262
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,587
I just got confirmation on Shaw.
They're going in.

263
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:13,398
Wait, wait, hold up...

264
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:17,444
Police scanners are saying
alarms are going off at Interpol headquarters.

265
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:18,570
Shit.

266
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,905
He brought us here
so he could take down Interpol.

267
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,407
This whole thing's a set-up.

268
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:24,534
-Brian, take the team.
-What about you?

269
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:26,870
Hobbs and I will
wait for Shaw.

270
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:28,788
Shaw leads to Letty.

271
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,964
Come on, you son of a bitch.

272
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,305
What's this?

273
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,433
It's your share
from the last job.

274
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:52,645
You're part
of the team, Oakes.

275
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,814
You do your job,
you get paid.

276
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:58,276
There's a little
extra in there for you.

277
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,321
Consider it an advance.

278
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:02,697
For what?

279
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,992
The next job, of course.

280
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:07,994
Which job?

281
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:10,872
The one we're
working right now.

282
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,628
Han, how far
are we from Interpol?

283
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,004
Twelve blocks away.

284
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:19,589
You guys,
it's a ghost town over here.

285
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:21,257
Shaw must have pulled
all the cops to him.

286
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:24,427
All right, y'all,
we're in this shit, so let's go get it.

287
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,182
It's been fun
running with you, mate.

288
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:36,856
Stop! Drop the bag!

289
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,110
-There he is.
-On it.

290
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:28,700
Toretto, it's on you.
Straight ahead, don't lose him.

291
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:29,868
Ain't gonna happen.

292
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:33,640
Sorry about that, boys.

293
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,155
Interpol, straight ahead.

294
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,621
Let's go, guys.
We've got company.

295
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:15,515
Let's go, boys.

296
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:18,268
Get in! Let's go!

297
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,031
Hey! We got to move. Now!

298
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:41,708
-Shaw, we have three cars tailing us.
-You know what to do.

299
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:54,721
Guys, I got the Rover.

300
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:56,556
Okay, I got...

301
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,101
Whatever the hell
that thing is.

302
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:14,407
What is that, a hockey puck?

303
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:47,190
Oh, shit!

304
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,304
Approaching
rendezvous point.

305
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:25,353
Dom! Tej and Roman are out! Where you at?

306
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:26,646
I'm right behind you!

307
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:48,668
Stay on track.
I'm taking the contingency.

308
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,507
Boys, I got eyes on Shaw.
He just made a left.

309
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,676
- I got right.
- Toretto, make that left!

310
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:07,854
No problem.

311
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:20,343
Letty.

312
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,945
Take the wheel.

313
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,063
Letty.

314
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:30,663
This is crazy.

315
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:33,416
We are not in Brazil.

316
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:37,003
So, now we got cars
flying in the air?

317
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:40,256
On some 007-type shit?
This is not what we do!

318
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:42,759
Man, you really got
to check that emotion.

319
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:45,679
Your voice just
went from Shaggy to Scooby-Doo.

320
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:47,514
"This is not what we..."

321
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:50,934
See, man, when a woman
starts shooting at you,

322
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:53,853
that's a clear sign
to back the fuck off!

323
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:57,399
We need to get
the hell out of Dodge!

324
00:30:58,483 --> 00:31:01,194
That could have been
my forehead, man.

325
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:02,612
No.

326
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:04,864
That's not as big
as your forehead.

327
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:12,872
Mia...

328
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:16,710
Uh, It's definitely Letty.

329
00:31:16,835 --> 00:31:18,920
But it's, uh.. It's complicated.

330
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:20,714
Letty's alive.

331
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:22,882
That's all that matters.

332
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,677
We have her back, Brian.

333
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:32,350
Well, do me a favor
and give Jack a kiss goodnight for me.

334
00:31:32,517 --> 00:31:34,728
-Be safe.
-I love you, Mia.

335
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,827
She definitely saw
it was you?

336
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:53,663
She looked dead at me, Brian.

337
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:57,500
Maybe the Letty
we once knew is gone, Dom.

338
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:01,921
Even though she's alive,
maybe she's gone.

339
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:05,759
You don't turn
your back on family.

340
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,096
Even when they do.

341
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:31,284
-Ivory.
-Yo.

342
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:33,953
It's going to
need some repairs.

343
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,955
No problem, treacle.

344
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:38,041
Are you good?

345
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:39,918
Yeah.

346
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:43,129
Okay, listen up.

347
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:47,092
That was a very
different breed

348
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:49,135
from Hobbs' usual
wannabe warriors.

349
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:51,971
We need to learn
who these people are, what they're made of.

350
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:53,098
Vegh?

351
00:32:56,768 --> 00:32:58,645
O'Conner, Parker,

352
00:32:59,562 --> 00:33:02,232
Pearce, Toretto

353
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,609
and the rest of the team.

354
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:07,153
These guys are
common criminals.

355
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,322
Tonight these
common criminals were seconds away

356
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:10,782
from taking us down.

357
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:14,119
Show them
the respect they deserve, or it weakens us.

358
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:16,496
You might
want to see this.

359
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:24,963
Ring any bells?

360
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:33,972
Yeah.

361
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:37,559
That's the guy I shot.

362
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:38,768
You look happy.

363
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:40,270
I don't remember him.

364
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:41,688
That's bullshit.

365
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:43,523
We got a problem, guys.

366
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:46,359
We got a picture of her
with the guy who almost took you out.

367
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,319
Klaus, aren't you
team muscle?

368
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:52,073
Don't make me go over there
and make you team pussy.

369
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:56,369
She doesn't
remember him.

370
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:59,205
Names and records
aren't enough.

371
00:33:59,372 --> 00:34:03,668
I want personal information.
Get into their lives, into their minds.

372
00:34:03,835 --> 00:34:06,671
Find their weaknesses,
and we will exploit them.

373
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:14,262
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, right.

374
00:34:15,638 --> 00:34:17,223
This is crazy, man.

375
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,892
What are you
talking about now?

376
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:21,644
I'm sitting here
looking at these images...

377
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:24,522
It's like we're hunting
our evil twins.

378
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:27,233
Look at this
black dude right here, he's handsome.

379
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:28,735
Clearly, that's me.

380
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:32,739
We got a white Hobbs.
This is Han.

381
00:34:33,365 --> 00:34:36,409
Tej, it's an African
in a beanie.

382
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:38,703
That's like
your Mini-Me, man.

383
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,164
And Brian!

384
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:44,501
When did you do
this photo shoot?

385
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:46,252
I'm just playing, man.

386
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:48,880
You know you're
the prettiest blonde around here.

387
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:58,932
All right, lock it up.
We got two things.

388
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:02,227
First off, this is the worst damn city in the
world to commit a crime.

389
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:04,062
They got cameras on
every street corner.

390
00:35:04,229 --> 00:35:06,564
I got video footage
from CCTV of the raid.

391
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:07,774
Let's track that,
see where it leads us.

392
00:35:08,191 --> 00:35:09,734
And secondly,
we just got confirmation

393
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:11,277
on what Shaw's crew
grabbed from Interpol.

394
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:12,612
They ripped off
the database

395
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:15,615
of every location that houses the
final component that they need.

396
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,783
So where are they at?

397
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:18,618
There are over
two dozen of them around Europe.

398
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:20,912
But the list is
only good for 96 hours.

399
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:23,039
Which means,
wherever Shaw's crew is going to hit next,

400
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:25,041
it's going to happen
within the next four days.

401
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:26,459
They got a window,
and so do we.

402
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:28,253
- We gotta move.
- Hobbs is right.

403
00:35:28,503 --> 00:35:29,796
So let's break this down.

404
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:31,006
You met them.
What do we know?

405
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:33,174
We know they
have to be running custom engines.

406
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:35,093
You heard that flip car
going through those gears.

407
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,469
Sequential transmission.

408
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:37,971
That didn't sound
like a normal engine.

409
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:39,764
That was a turbo diesel.

410
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,141
It sounded like something
you hear at Le Mans.

411
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:42,308
Did you see it
take all those hits

412
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:43,601
and still stay flat
in the corners?

413
00:35:43,643 --> 00:35:44,811
Yeah, hydraulics.

414
00:35:44,936 --> 00:35:46,104
Or magnetic suspension.

415
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:48,440
Who not only has
access to the components,

416
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:49,816
but can fabricate
something like that?

417
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:51,776
Maybe a handful
of shops in London.

418
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:54,529
Regular tuner shops
aren't going to cut it on this one.

419
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:56,531
We're going to have to
dig deeper than that.

420
00:35:57,282 --> 00:35:59,159
Han, Gisele, Roman,
you're up.

421
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,162
We find the guy
who made that car,

422
00:36:02,662 --> 00:36:03,747
we find Shaw.

423
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,458
--Let's go.

424
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:08,626
-I'll help.
-Roger that.

425
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:12,589
Tej, we're gonna need cars without computer
chips that can be overridden.

426
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:14,466
Make sure they're fast.

427
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:17,010
I got this.

428
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:19,804
I'm already on it, Dom.
I've contacted R&D at DSS.

429
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:21,431
Hobbs...

430
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:23,224
I said I got this.

431
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:27,687
This should be interesting.

432
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:42,702
Man, you really
got to loosen up.

433
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:45,622
You can't just throw a bunch of factory-line
Beemers at people and expect...

434
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:47,374
Hey. That car is a hell of a car.

435
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,292
You're talking about twin-turbo V8,

436
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:51,378
spitting out 560 ponies, son.

437
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:54,130
He reads the brochure. I'm proud.

438
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:56,091
But with cars,
you have to customize.

439
00:36:56,549 --> 00:36:58,385
It's all between you
and the car you build.

440
00:36:58,468 --> 00:37:00,136
It's a bond,
it's a commitment.

441
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:01,930
It sounds like a marriage.

442
00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:03,723
Yeah, but with cars,
when you trade up,

443
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:04,891
they don't take
half your shit.

444
00:37:08,061 --> 00:37:09,062
Jesus.

445
00:37:09,145 --> 00:37:11,481
With price tags like this,
these cars better be made out of gold.

446
00:37:15,026 --> 00:37:17,821
You ain't thinking about
stealing these cars, are you, Parker?

447
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:20,699
Kitchen help entrance
is towards the back.

448
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:22,826
Come again?

449
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:24,244
I don't mean any offense,
gentlemen,

450
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:27,080
but you couldn't
possibly afford the cars in this auction.

451
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:31,418
Substantial lack
of gaudy jewelry, no entourage, no honeys.

452
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:33,628
Clearly you're
not a "baller."

453
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,005
And you.

454
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:38,091
Hmm. Shoes, shirt, trousers.

455
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:39,592
Functional.

456
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:41,761
And your posture,
too rigid, no swagger.

457
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:44,389
My guess is military.
Take home of 50,000 a year.

458
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:46,182
That's U.S.

459
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:47,559
Which is not enough
to be playing here.

460
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:49,394
So, if you're not
kitchen help,

461
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:51,479
then you must be
in the wrong place.

462
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:56,067
But please,
do finish your champagne.

463
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,239
Oh, he needs to be
taught a lesson.

464
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:04,325
Like I said,
you ain't stealing these cars.

465
00:38:05,076 --> 00:38:06,953
I got this.

466
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:14,794
All right, this is
number five on our list.

467
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:20,300
Holy shit.

468
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:23,720
What's the dude plan on hunting? Moby Dick?

469
00:38:23,803 --> 00:38:25,430
That must be our guy.

470
00:38:25,597 --> 00:38:27,724
So, how do you all
want to play this?

471
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:29,893
Han and I got this.

472
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:33,480
We go in tight,
you let me do all the talking,

473
00:38:33,605 --> 00:38:34,856
and you all
have my back on it.

474
00:38:35,106 --> 00:38:37,400
There's one thing
you boys are forgetting.

475
00:38:38,151 --> 00:38:40,153
He's a man.

476
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:41,738
Let's go.

477
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:44,324
"He's a man"?

478
00:38:45,241 --> 00:38:48,161
You know,
she always says that.

479
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:58,838
What you're looking at
is a 5.45 by 18 FMJ spitzer bullet.

480
00:38:59,005 --> 00:39:02,008
It's specific to one handgun, the PSM.

481
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:04,844
Given that handguns are
illegal in the United Kingdom,

482
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:07,681
there's very few people
that have access to that firearm.

483
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:09,349
So if somebody wanted to, say,

484
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:11,518
track down where it came from,

485
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:13,853
it wouldn't be too hard.

486
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:16,815
I was a cop for a lot of years.
Some habits die hard.

487
00:39:17,315 --> 00:39:19,818
A pawn shop.

488
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:29,202
I don't know, man.
That was disrespectful.

489
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:30,870
And I don't like
the way she said it,

490
00:39:30,912 --> 00:39:32,789
like, "He's a man."

491
00:39:33,331 --> 00:39:35,875
"He's a man"?
So, what are we?

492
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:38,586
Come on,
she's just doing her job.

493
00:39:39,337 --> 00:39:41,548
"Doing her job."

494
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:44,342
I see what's going on.

495
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:46,386
See what?

496
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:49,639
You got the little
stardust in your eyes, eh?

497
00:39:50,056 --> 00:39:52,058
Little birds floating
around a little bit.

498
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,149
Uh, you don't want to lease this model.
You want to buy.

499
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:00,483
Can you please stop talking?

500
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:04,571
No, no, you're in love! Look at you!

501
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:06,072
Just stop.

502
00:40:06,406 --> 00:40:08,742
You got special plans?
Big day?

503
00:40:08,825 --> 00:40:09,909
You're going to
invite us all out?

504
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:12,162
Better make sure you
get her a big rock, man,

505
00:40:12,328 --> 00:40:14,330
'cause she doesn't
look like she'll be that easily impressed.

506
00:40:14,914 --> 00:40:16,583
And if it's not
a big rock,

507
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:17,751
you better be big
somewhere else.

508
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:20,211
You know what I'm talking about.

509
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:23,757
That's why all your girlfriends wear
so much bling, huh?

510
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:27,427
We're looking for information.

511
00:40:27,677 --> 00:40:29,637
You're looking for information? About what?

512
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:32,807
Information about cars.

513
00:40:33,683 --> 00:40:36,019
In particular,
two you designed recently.

514
00:40:36,102 --> 00:40:38,938
Ramp cars.
Low slung, skeletal frames.

515
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,484
We'd be very interested
to find the man who bought those.

516
00:40:42,567 --> 00:40:43,610
Why should I help you?

517
00:40:43,693 --> 00:40:45,028
Because we're
asking you nicely.

518
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:46,488
Because you're
asking me nicely?

519
00:40:46,654 --> 00:40:49,449
What can you offer
that I can't get from a thousand other girls?

520
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:51,493
Hmm?

521
00:40:54,662 --> 00:40:55,747
Stop! Stop!

522
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:05,632
You look like a man
who likes it rough.

523
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:10,553
My friend here can
give you heights of pain

524
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:13,431
you've never
experienced before.

525
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:16,476
Do we have a deal?

526
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:20,105
Deal! Deal! Deal!

527
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:21,356
I take it back.

528
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:24,401
Me likey.

529
00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:39,457
Stop, stop, stop.

530
00:41:39,624 --> 00:41:42,168
So this is how you "got this"?
By buying all of his cars?

531
00:41:42,335 --> 00:41:44,337
What good is having
millions of dollars in the bank

532
00:41:44,504 --> 00:41:45,839
if you don't spend
any of it?

533
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:47,841
But don't worry about that.
Watch this.

534
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:51,970
Mr. Parker, again,
can I just express our gratitude

535
00:41:52,137 --> 00:41:54,472
and say how much
we appreciate your business.

536
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:57,267
If there's ever
anything else you need, you just have to ask.

537
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:58,393
-Anything?
-Mmm-hmm.

538
00:41:58,518 --> 00:42:01,187
Now that you mention it,
my swagger-less friend here,

539
00:42:01,354 --> 00:42:03,982
he really likes
that shirt you have on.

540
00:42:04,649 --> 00:42:06,109
Uh, this shirt?

541
00:42:06,443 --> 00:42:07,527
That shirt.

542
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:10,530
I'm not entirely sure that this shirt
would fit your friend.

543
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:11,698
It will fit.

544
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:13,450
He needs a shirt
that's a little less...

545
00:42:13,533 --> 00:42:14,617
Functional.

546
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:16,369
That's it, functional.

547
00:42:19,789 --> 00:42:20,999
Okay.

548
00:42:25,795 --> 00:42:27,547
-I'll hold that.
-Thank you.

549
00:42:27,797 --> 00:42:29,341
Come on, man,
time is money.

550
00:42:29,507 --> 00:42:30,592
Yes, doing my best.

551
00:42:33,553 --> 00:42:36,389
Damn, you need
some hedge clippers for that shit.

552
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:40,060
Well, if that will be all...

553
00:42:40,185 --> 00:42:42,103
And the pants, too.

554
00:42:49,444 --> 00:42:50,570
Right.

555
00:42:51,279 --> 00:42:53,531
While you're at it,
let me get that watch.

556
00:42:53,615 --> 00:42:54,824
I like that watch.

557
00:43:05,126 --> 00:43:06,461
This is for you.

558
00:43:06,628 --> 00:43:08,588
-And this is for you.
-Thank you.

559
00:43:08,922 --> 00:43:11,424
Good day, gentlemen.
Thank you.

560
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:19,849
So I, um,

561
00:43:19,933 --> 00:43:22,185
I got the information in here.

562
00:43:33,738 --> 00:43:36,991
May I ask why
you're looking for Shaw?

563
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:39,786
He took something of ours.

564
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:42,580
We'd like to talk
to him about it.

565
00:43:42,622 --> 00:43:44,749
Let's see
what we've got.

566
00:43:58,722 --> 00:44:00,598
All right.
What do you want?

567
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,892
They say
if someone's looking for a Russian gun,

568
00:44:03,184 --> 00:44:04,310
you're the man to see.

569
00:44:04,352 --> 00:44:06,730
Oh, they do, do they?

570
00:44:10,817 --> 00:44:12,277
What do you want, mate?

571
00:44:19,617 --> 00:44:21,536
That might be a bad idea.

572
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:28,835
-I'm looking for the owner of this.
-I don't know.

573
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:33,214
Take a closer look.

574
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:35,342
About a week ago,
a girl came in,

575
00:44:35,425 --> 00:44:36,843
bought guns, ammo,
everything I had.

576
00:44:36,926 --> 00:44:38,595
A girl?

577
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:40,138
What did she look like?

578
00:44:40,305 --> 00:44:41,639
Tough chick, dark hair.

579
00:44:42,223 --> 00:44:43,308
Mean streak.

580
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:45,727
Word is
she's a street racer.

581
00:44:45,852 --> 00:44:46,895
Where can we find her?

582
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,646
How do I know?
Do I look like a racer?

583
00:44:50,732 --> 00:44:53,693
No. You don't.

584
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:02,118
Take care, guys.

585
00:45:09,542 --> 00:45:10,627
Oh, shit.

586
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:27,477
Sorry, girls.

587
00:45:32,899 --> 00:45:34,109
Let's go!

588
00:46:23,408 --> 00:46:24,492
Hold on.

589
00:46:24,576 --> 00:46:27,412
Stay with me. Stay with me.

590
00:46:27,579 --> 00:46:28,913
Tell me where
to find Shaw,

591
00:46:28,997 --> 00:46:30,999
and I'll make him
pay for this.

592
00:46:38,173 --> 00:46:39,799
Braga...

593
00:47:12,374 --> 00:47:13,750
Ow!

594
00:47:31,518 --> 00:47:32,977
Hey, you!

595
00:47:33,144 --> 00:47:34,187
Stop right there!

596
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:03,568
-You go!
-No, you go!

597
00:50:16,975 --> 00:50:19,310
No one needs to
know about this.

598
00:50:19,894 --> 00:50:21,312
No one.

599
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:37,704
We lost Ivory.

600
00:50:37,871 --> 00:50:39,414
He's gone.

601
00:50:40,081 --> 00:50:41,166
Thanks.

602
00:50:46,379 --> 00:50:47,422
That's it?

603
00:50:48,006 --> 00:50:50,842
If Ivory's dead,
he made a mistake.

604
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:54,512
If you make a mistake,
you pay the price.

605
00:50:58,683 --> 00:51:00,352
That's a great eulogy, Shaw.

606
00:51:01,561 --> 00:51:03,229
Are you going to
give the same speech

607
00:51:03,313 --> 00:51:05,106
for the rest of us
when we go out?

608
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:26,961
You're the last one
I'd have pegged to be sentimental.

609
00:51:31,466 --> 00:51:33,218
I like you, Letty.

610
00:51:34,386 --> 00:51:37,847
I dare say I even
feel a certain warmth towards you.

611
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:39,391
When I found you
in the hospital,

612
00:51:39,474 --> 00:51:41,935
and you couldn't
remember anything,

613
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:44,229
I said to myself,

614
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:48,441
"This girl has a gift.

615
00:51:49,567 --> 00:51:51,861
"She's a blank page."

616
00:51:52,946 --> 00:51:56,616
And that made me feel
somewhat protective toward you.

617
00:51:57,909 --> 00:52:00,954
If something happened to you, for instance,

618
00:52:01,037 --> 00:52:04,290
I think I might find that
slightly harder to bear.

619
00:52:07,293 --> 00:52:09,295
What I'm saying is,

620
00:52:09,963 --> 00:52:13,091
I would hate to see you

621
00:52:13,258 --> 00:52:15,468
make a mistake.

622
00:52:22,684 --> 00:52:24,561
I'm going to get some air.

623
00:52:52,464 --> 00:52:54,466
-What the hell happened?
-We met Dom's girlfriend.

624
00:52:55,008 --> 00:52:56,926
She's lovely.

625
00:52:57,093 --> 00:52:58,970
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

626
00:52:59,137 --> 00:53:01,389
Tej, what have you got? Footage, CCTV?
Talk to me.

627
00:53:01,556 --> 00:53:03,099
I just went
through all of it.

628
00:53:03,266 --> 00:53:06,019
Believe it or not, everywhere Shaw's team is,
the cameras are down.

629
00:53:06,186 --> 00:53:08,104
That's a hell
of a coincidence.

630
00:53:08,938 --> 00:53:11,983
All right, we're going to pay CCTV a little visit.
Let's roll.

631
00:53:12,567 --> 00:53:13,777
What is that?

632
00:53:13,943 --> 00:53:16,321
That is a new toy for you.

633
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:17,655
So, what happened?

634
00:53:17,822 --> 00:53:20,408
Shaw's goons showed up
and started shooting up the place.

635
00:53:20,492 --> 00:53:21,868
But we got something big.

636
00:53:22,118 --> 00:53:23,536
- What?
- Braga.

637
00:53:24,913 --> 00:53:26,873
He's working with Shaw.

638
00:53:28,416 --> 00:53:29,542
What are you talking about?

639
00:53:29,709 --> 00:53:32,462
It's true. That phone's filled
with coded payment transactions

640
00:53:32,629 --> 00:53:34,464
that lead straight
to Braga's cartel.

641
00:53:34,631 --> 00:53:36,132
Who the hell is Braga?

642
00:53:36,299 --> 00:53:39,135
He ran one of the biggest cartels in Mexico.

643
00:53:39,219 --> 00:53:40,595
And my old boss.

644
00:53:41,346 --> 00:53:43,139
We used codes
just like that

645
00:53:43,223 --> 00:53:44,307
to move money
out of the country.

646
00:53:44,474 --> 00:53:45,558
It all makes sense.

647
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:48,269
Braga was running Letty,
now he's working with Shaw.

648
00:53:48,436 --> 00:53:49,771
It would explain how
the two of them met.

649
00:53:49,854 --> 00:53:51,064
Okay, so you all know
all this information

650
00:53:51,147 --> 00:53:52,482
about him,
where do we find him?

651
00:53:52,565 --> 00:53:54,484
He's sitting in a prison in Los Angeles.

652
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:55,902
How do you know that?

653
00:53:58,029 --> 00:54:00,031
Brian put him there.

654
00:54:00,198 --> 00:54:01,950
All right,
so this is the break we were looking for.

655
00:54:02,117 --> 00:54:04,411
If the two of them were working together,

656
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:05,995
Braga will know what Shaw's up to.

657
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,372
I'm going to pay him a visit.

658
00:54:07,455 --> 00:54:09,082
Are you serious right now?

659
00:54:09,457 --> 00:54:11,626
Think about what you're saying.

660
00:54:11,918 --> 00:54:13,420
You're wanted, Brian.

661
00:54:14,004 --> 00:54:17,507
The moment you step
foot off that plane, it's a wrap.

662
00:54:17,924 --> 00:54:19,092
You're not coming back.

663
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,678
"Coming back"?
How are you going to get in the country?

664
00:54:21,845 --> 00:54:23,722
Let me worry about that.

665
00:54:31,354 --> 00:54:33,023
This is on me.

666
00:54:34,024 --> 00:54:36,401
I'm the one that served her up to Braga.

667
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,363
I'm the one that gets to make it right.

668
00:54:42,866 --> 00:54:44,701
Let me make it right.

669
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:48,163
Be careful.

670
00:54:55,462 --> 00:54:57,088
He's ready to see you now.
Right this way.

671
00:55:00,925 --> 00:55:03,345
Thank you for seeing us.
I won't take up much of your time.

672
00:55:03,553 --> 00:55:05,138
My men were attacked earlier today.

673
00:55:05,221 --> 00:55:06,639
I'm going to need to see all cameras

674
00:55:06,806 --> 00:55:09,225
in and around Waterloo station.

675
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:11,770
Will somebody
tell Captain America here

676
00:55:11,811 --> 00:55:13,813
- that requires clearance?

677
00:55:18,109 --> 00:55:19,402
Terry,

678
00:55:20,153 --> 00:55:23,740
bring up cameras 58 through 62, earlier today.

679
00:55:26,701 --> 00:55:28,828
They've been down for maintenance
all morning.

680
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:30,663
Sorry.

681
00:55:30,997 --> 00:55:34,167
Okay. Well, we appreciate your help.
Thank you.

682
00:55:38,755 --> 00:55:40,674
You know what I find very interesting

683
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,635
is Interpol was attacked recently as well.

684
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:46,012
Those cameras were down, too.
Didn't catch a thing.

685
00:55:46,346 --> 00:55:47,472
Nothing.

686
00:55:48,264 --> 00:55:49,432
Now, that means either

687
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,101
your maintenance schedule lines up

688
00:55:51,184 --> 00:55:52,435
perfectly with their escape route

689
00:55:52,602 --> 00:55:55,188
or it's someone here
that's working with them.

690
00:55:55,522 --> 00:55:58,024
And that's just ridiculous.

691
00:55:58,233 --> 00:55:59,275
Because there ain't no way in hell

692
00:55:59,442 --> 00:56:01,820
anybody here would be working for them.

693
00:56:01,945 --> 00:56:03,446
Particularly you,
ain't that right?

694
00:56:03,655 --> 00:56:05,657
No, no, that's ridiculous.

695
00:56:05,824 --> 00:56:07,283
That is ridiculous.

696
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:10,245
I'm going to need direct access
to your live feed

697
00:56:10,328 --> 00:56:11,371
citywide.

698
00:56:11,496 --> 00:56:14,708
And I also strongly suggest
that you put a hold on any more

699
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:15,959
"maintenance."

700
00:56:16,126 --> 00:56:18,003
Yeah, of course.

701
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,547
We appreciate your help.
Thank you so much.

702
00:56:39,274 --> 00:56:41,609
Well, well, well.

703
00:56:41,776 --> 00:56:43,945
The orange in that
really makes your eyes pop.

704
00:56:50,744 --> 00:56:52,495
Thanks, fellas.

705
00:56:52,662 --> 00:56:54,289
Tell me something,
O'Conner,

706
00:56:54,539 --> 00:56:56,374
how is it you keep
running around the world,

707
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:57,584
breaking every law
known to man,

708
00:56:57,834 --> 00:57:00,545
and yet here I am,
putting my job on the line for you?

709
00:57:00,754 --> 00:57:03,548
You'll feel a lot better
once you get the credit for taking down Shaw.

710
00:57:04,424 --> 00:57:06,426
Oh, I'm tempted
to settle for you.

711
00:57:07,177 --> 00:57:09,220
Well, you know what
they say, Stasiak,

712
00:57:09,387 --> 00:57:10,847
if you want the
career-changing big fish,

713
00:57:11,014 --> 00:57:12,682
you got to be willing
to put on the big boy panties

714
00:57:12,766 --> 00:57:14,809
and sail out
to the deep water.

715
00:57:14,893 --> 00:57:16,353
You're an asshole,
you know that?

716
00:57:21,274 --> 00:57:24,110
I missed you, too, man.
I really missed you.

717
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:28,656
I got you admitted into Victorville
to do whatever you got to do.

718
00:57:28,823 --> 00:57:30,408
It's a 24-hour hold.

719
00:57:30,575 --> 00:57:32,243
You need to be out
of there by 9:00 a.m.

720
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:35,747
That's when Forensics will run your
fingerprints through the national database.

721
00:57:35,914 --> 00:57:37,665
That program will match you

722
00:57:37,832 --> 00:57:39,584
and when they find out
who you really are,

723
00:57:39,668 --> 00:57:41,378
I won't be able to
get you back out.

724
00:57:42,003 --> 00:57:43,588
We're talking life in prison.

725
00:57:51,137 --> 00:57:52,305
Cute kid.

726
00:57:56,309 --> 00:58:00,814
So, I found out Braga's being held
in cell block D3.

727
00:58:01,064 --> 00:58:02,107
That's solitary.

728
00:58:02,273 --> 00:58:04,734
I only had enough juice
to get you in Gen Pop.

729
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:08,405
So you're going to have to
do something to get his attention.

730
00:58:09,364 --> 00:58:10,407
Sorry about this, man.

731
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:11,574
Sorry about what?

732
00:58:22,627 --> 00:58:24,129
Again?

733
00:58:32,178 --> 00:58:34,597
Big Brother's
about to go live.

734
00:58:39,185 --> 00:58:42,188
Damn, you can't flick a booger in London
without somebody noticing.

735
00:58:46,026 --> 00:58:48,695
Hey! Don't touch that.
That's nothing to play with, man.

736
00:58:48,862 --> 00:58:49,863
What's the problem?

737
00:58:49,904 --> 00:58:51,948
That's high-tensile
titanium cable.

738
00:58:52,657 --> 00:58:53,658
What does that mean?

739
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,702
That's what they use
to anchor buildings and hold up bridges,

740
00:58:55,869 --> 00:58:57,871
stuff you know
nothing about!

741
00:58:58,038 --> 00:59:00,540
See, now, their version,
it works cool,

742
00:59:00,665 --> 00:59:03,710
but mine, masterpiece.

743
00:59:03,918 --> 00:59:06,755
See, I reversed the gears,
torqued the motor

744
00:59:07,213 --> 00:59:09,090
and added this tank
to the back.

745
00:59:09,716 --> 00:59:10,925
That makes it even sweeter.

746
00:59:11,051 --> 00:59:12,052
It does.

747
00:59:12,218 --> 00:59:13,428
It's not dummy-proof.

748
00:59:13,595 --> 00:59:15,889
Man, I've been known to handle big guns.
Relax.

749
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:17,807
You've been
known to handle that big-ass head.

750
00:59:18,058 --> 00:59:20,727
Dom, I did some checking,
asked around,

751
00:59:20,894 --> 00:59:22,771
got the location of
a street race tonight.

752
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:14,447
Brian O'Conner.

753
01:00:14,656 --> 01:00:16,783
That was quite an entrance.

754
01:00:22,914 --> 01:00:24,958
You put a lot of
these men in here.

755
01:00:25,458 --> 01:00:28,294
What?
You didn't think one would recognize you?

756
01:00:31,006 --> 01:00:33,842
I've kept tabs on you, you know.

757
01:00:34,342 --> 01:00:36,678
You've been having a lot of fun out there.

758
01:00:36,803 --> 01:00:40,473
Good cop gone bad,
Rio de Janeiro.

759
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:43,059
It's exciting when you go criminal, isn't it?

760
01:00:43,309 --> 01:00:46,354
Too bad you didn't do it earlier,
you could have worked for me.

761
01:00:46,521 --> 01:00:48,148
Like Letty Ortiz?

762
01:00:50,358 --> 01:00:52,360
So tell me something,
because I buried her.

763
01:00:52,527 --> 01:00:54,154
Yeah? You did?

764
01:00:54,195 --> 01:00:56,906
You buried something,
I couldn't tell you who or what it was.

765
01:00:58,283 --> 01:01:00,452
I know she's running with Owen Shaw.

766
01:01:01,828 --> 01:01:03,830
Still playing cop, huh?

767
01:01:04,664 --> 01:01:07,083
Trust me, this is way above your pay grade.

768
01:01:09,002 --> 01:01:10,211
Humor me, please.

769
01:01:11,338 --> 01:01:14,841
Well, you're a dead man walking,
what does it matter?

770
01:01:16,343 --> 01:01:18,178
I ran everything for Shaw.

771
01:01:18,345 --> 01:01:21,848
Drugs, guns, money, women.

772
01:01:22,015 --> 01:01:24,851
He taught me to think global
when I was just local.

773
01:01:25,018 --> 01:01:26,519
He made me a wealthy man.

774
01:01:26,686 --> 01:01:28,730
And this guy didn't just have
the cartels working for him.

775
01:01:28,813 --> 01:01:33,443
He had the CIA, DEA,
everyone in his pocket.

776
01:01:33,693 --> 01:01:35,862
He knew what was
going to happen before they did.

777
01:01:35,945 --> 01:01:40,450
In fact, he even knew when
some wet-behind-the-ears FBI agent

778
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:43,745
decided to put some informant in my cartel.

779
01:01:56,883 --> 01:01:59,511
The minute you put Letty undercover,
she was dead, bro.

780
01:02:38,258 --> 01:02:39,759
But she survived.

781
01:02:40,093 --> 01:02:41,761
That girl is one tough bitch.

782
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:44,597
Shaw found her
in a hospital two days later.

783
01:02:44,764 --> 01:02:46,975
He went to finish the job.

784
01:02:47,142 --> 01:02:49,144
And he didn't kill her. Why?

785
01:02:49,936 --> 01:02:51,938
She had no memory.

786
01:02:52,814 --> 01:02:54,566
Perfect girl, huh?

787
01:02:56,526 --> 01:02:58,653
You're lucky this door's between us.

788
01:03:05,076 --> 01:03:07,412
What happened to Letty
is on your head.

789
01:03:42,947 --> 01:03:44,908
Look at me! Look at me.

790
01:03:46,326 --> 01:03:48,161
You won't do it.

791
01:03:49,829 --> 01:03:51,331
What is Shaw up to?

792
01:03:51,498 --> 01:03:54,417
How do you think he knows your next move
before you make it?

793
01:03:54,668 --> 01:03:56,211
He's got eyes on you.

794
01:03:56,378 --> 01:03:58,004
Think about it.

795
01:04:02,133 --> 01:04:04,552
The only way you get close to Shaw

796
01:04:04,803 --> 01:04:06,346
is if he wants you there.

797
01:05:50,492 --> 01:05:52,494
You've got some
serious balls, man.

798
01:05:52,869 --> 01:05:54,287
I've been told.

799
01:05:55,205 --> 01:05:57,123
You know, you're lucky I missed my shot.

800
01:05:57,957 --> 01:05:59,292
I think you hit your mark.

801
01:05:59,459 --> 01:06:00,669
Really?

802
01:06:01,628 --> 01:06:02,712
What is it with you?

803
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:04,756
Do you got a death wish or something?

804
01:06:04,964 --> 01:06:06,633
If that's what it takes.

805
01:06:06,716 --> 01:06:08,635
I just want to race.

806
01:06:10,053 --> 01:06:11,513
You might lose your car.

807
01:06:15,558 --> 01:06:17,060
Let's do it.

808
01:06:17,477 --> 01:06:19,312
Your funeral.

809
01:06:19,938 --> 01:06:22,148
Ride or die, remember?

810
01:06:30,824 --> 01:06:31,991
Listen up!

811
01:06:32,701 --> 01:06:35,203
Out here, we're used
to getting what we want.

812
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:36,496
This is London, baby.

813
01:06:38,081 --> 01:06:39,582
But remember,

814
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:42,752
don't bite the bait.

815
01:06:42,919 --> 01:06:44,546
Are you ready?

816
01:06:45,505 --> 01:06:47,048
-Ready?
-Ready.

817
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:52,053
Steady.

818
01:06:55,682 --> 01:06:56,725
Go!

819
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:49,652
Just like old times.

820
01:08:37,867 --> 01:08:38,910
This guy is crazy.

821
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,035
You got to be kidding me.

822
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:52,192
You're still upshifting early.

823
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:54,778
I do that so you brake.

824
01:09:55,695 --> 01:09:58,782
You lose traction
and the back end kicks out.

825
01:09:59,699 --> 01:10:00,700
I noticed.

826
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:06,206
Look, just because you know how I ride,
doesn't mean you know me.

827
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:09,125
You know what they say
where we're from?

828
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,879
Show me how you drive,
I'll show you who you are.

829
01:10:14,881 --> 01:10:16,383
V8.

830
01:10:17,384 --> 01:10:19,886
You never could resist
American muscle.

831
01:10:24,057 --> 01:10:25,392
Nice scar.

832
01:10:30,563 --> 01:10:33,733
You never could
keep yourself out of trouble, either.

833
01:10:37,237 --> 01:10:38,738
What else do you know about me?

834
01:10:39,739 --> 01:10:41,241
About you?

835
01:10:43,702 --> 01:10:45,203
Everything.

836
01:10:52,085 --> 01:10:54,254
Like this scar.

837
01:10:54,421 --> 01:10:58,008
You got that the first night we met.
You were 15.

838
01:10:58,174 --> 01:11:00,427
First street race.

839
01:11:01,261 --> 01:11:05,181
Some kid trying to show off
lost control of his car,

840
01:11:05,348 --> 01:11:07,934
wiped out right next to you.

841
01:11:07,976 --> 01:11:10,311
You're lucky you didn't lose your arm.

842
01:11:10,603 --> 01:11:12,022
And let me guess,

843
01:11:12,772 --> 01:11:14,607
you saved me.

844
01:11:14,774 --> 01:11:16,276
No.

845
01:11:16,943 --> 01:11:19,112
I was the kid showing off.

846
01:11:22,282 --> 01:11:23,616
And here...

847
01:11:30,123 --> 01:11:31,958
Boyle Heights.

848
01:11:32,959 --> 01:11:37,047
You were fleeing with my little sister Mia
and got trapped in a corner.

849
01:11:38,048 --> 01:11:40,467
And you thought
it was a good idea

850
01:11:40,633 --> 01:11:44,304
to ride your Torino Cobra
through a retaining wall.

851
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:50,643
All right, how about this one?

852
01:11:54,314 --> 01:11:57,484
That's the last time we were together.

853
01:11:58,985 --> 01:12:00,987
In the DR.

854
01:12:01,988 --> 01:12:04,574
You wanted to go for a night swim.

855
01:12:05,825 --> 01:12:08,078
You cut yourself on the reef.

856
01:12:08,203 --> 01:12:10,163
I followed you.

857
01:12:11,998 --> 01:12:14,834
I even got this scar to match.

858
01:12:17,337 --> 01:12:19,506
Look, I don't know why you're here,

859
01:12:19,673 --> 01:12:22,509
but I really think you're over your head.

860
01:12:30,934 --> 01:12:33,019
I'm here for you.

861
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:39,234
That girl you remember,

862
01:12:41,111 --> 01:12:42,779
it's not me.

863
01:12:44,447 --> 01:12:47,075
Not from what I just saw.

864
01:12:49,285 --> 01:12:50,954
Like it or not,

865
01:12:53,123 --> 01:12:54,791
you're still the same girl.

866
01:12:58,003 --> 01:13:00,296
I saw it out there.

867
01:13:01,965 --> 01:13:04,134
I see it right now.

868
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:08,013
I got to go.

869
01:13:10,265 --> 01:13:12,142
Hey.

870
01:13:21,443 --> 01:13:24,112
It belongs to you.

871
01:13:58,646 --> 01:14:00,398
There she goes,

872
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,941
leaving you again.

873
01:14:04,152 --> 01:14:05,987
Bloody fickle, that one.

874
01:14:07,113 --> 01:14:09,199
You want bloody?
We could do bloody.

875
01:14:12,744 --> 01:14:14,245
A street kid,

876
01:14:15,246 --> 01:14:18,041
starts out stealing DVD players in East L.A.,

877
01:14:19,709 --> 01:14:23,088
ends up heisting $100 million in Rio.

878
01:14:23,421 --> 01:14:24,923
Not bad, huh?

879
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:27,092
It's a good story, isn't it?

880
01:14:28,259 --> 01:14:30,095
Almost inspiring.

881
01:14:31,429 --> 01:14:33,890
See, what I couldn't fathom is

882
01:14:34,307 --> 01:14:36,476
why he's not relaxing on a beach somewhere

883
01:14:36,601 --> 01:14:39,104
with that cute little Brazilian number.

884
01:14:40,021 --> 01:14:45,026
Instead, he's working with
a two-bit government hack like Hobbs.

885
01:14:47,779 --> 01:14:49,572
And then I realized,

886
01:14:52,033 --> 01:14:53,618
he has a weak spot.

887
01:14:55,328 --> 01:14:57,706
We all got a weak spot.

888
01:14:58,623 --> 01:14:59,874
You know,

889
01:15:00,458 --> 01:15:04,546
when I was young,
my brother always used to say,

890
01:15:04,713 --> 01:15:07,257
"Every man has to have a code."

891
01:15:08,216 --> 01:15:09,467
Mine?

892
01:15:09,968 --> 01:15:11,428
Precision.

893
01:15:12,762 --> 01:15:16,641
A team is nothing but pieces you switch
out until you get the job done.

894
01:15:16,808 --> 01:15:18,059
It's efficient.

895
01:15:18,643 --> 01:15:19,936
It works.

896
01:15:20,979 --> 01:15:22,272
But you?

897
01:15:24,816 --> 01:15:26,651
You're loyal to a fault.

898
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,696
Your code is about family.

899
01:15:31,031 --> 01:15:34,534
And that's great in the holidays,
but it makes you predictable.

900
01:15:34,659 --> 01:15:37,162
And in our line of work,
predictable means vulnerable.

901
01:15:37,328 --> 01:15:40,915
And that means I can reach out
and break you whenever I want.

902
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:44,127
At least when I go,
I'll know what it's for.

903
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:47,005
Well,

904
01:15:48,089 --> 01:15:50,008
at least you have a code.

905
01:15:52,427 --> 01:15:53,762
Most men don't.

906
01:15:57,849 --> 01:15:59,142
So,

907
01:16:00,352 --> 01:16:02,145
I'm going to give you a chance.

908
01:16:03,688 --> 01:16:05,774
Take your crew and walk away.

909
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:08,526
That's the only way
you're going to keep your family safe.

910
01:16:11,154 --> 01:16:14,032
Your brother never told you never
to threaten a man's family?

911
01:16:15,867 --> 01:16:18,119
It's a pretty stupid thing to do.

912
01:16:20,288 --> 01:16:22,707
But I'll make it simple for you.

913
01:16:24,042 --> 01:16:27,045
I walk away when she walks away.

914
01:16:28,546 --> 01:16:29,798
Well, then,

915
01:16:31,883 --> 01:16:34,844
it appears this inspiring tale
has come to an end.

916
01:16:42,852 --> 01:16:44,521
If that's the way it has to go.

917
01:16:51,611 --> 01:16:53,613
Let me guess...

918
01:16:54,989 --> 01:16:56,032
Hobbs.

919
01:16:59,411 --> 01:17:01,996
Come on, you son of a bitch.

920
01:17:02,664 --> 01:17:04,624
The "two-bit government hack."

921
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:13,758
See you around, Toretto.

922
01:17:13,925 --> 01:17:15,427
You can bet on it.

923
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:33,194
Riley, Shaw's leaving Battersea,
heading southeast.

924
01:17:33,445 --> 01:17:35,113
Have Tej track him on his live feed. Go.

925
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:37,741
You know what
would have happened

926
01:17:37,824 --> 01:17:40,452
if I didn't put that tracker in your car?

927
01:17:42,746 --> 01:17:43,913
This one?

928
01:17:51,296 --> 01:17:55,175
You know, this just got me
one step closer to Shaw.

929
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,635
For what it's worth, Toretto,

930
01:17:58,053 --> 01:18:00,805
I hope it gets you closer
to what you want, too.

931
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:18,656
This better have been worth it.

932
01:18:19,157 --> 01:18:21,117
More than you'll ever know.

933
01:19:07,914 --> 01:19:09,124
Pretty.

934
01:19:14,004 --> 01:19:15,171
May I?

935
01:19:29,102 --> 01:19:31,855
I'm going to ask you a question, Letty,

936
01:19:32,605 --> 01:19:36,484
and I want you to think very hard
before you answer.

937
01:19:37,027 --> 01:19:39,571
When I give you the order

938
01:19:39,738 --> 01:19:41,156
to take Toretto out,

939
01:19:43,742 --> 01:19:46,161
what will your first thought be?

940
01:19:47,996 --> 01:19:50,498
Why don't you look me in the eye

941
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:55,337
and you tell me what you see.

942
01:20:04,387 --> 01:20:05,680
Keep it.

943
01:20:15,565 --> 01:20:17,567
Tej, talk to me, what have we got?

944
01:20:17,734 --> 01:20:20,070
We were able to track Shaw
after he left you and Dom,

945
01:20:20,236 --> 01:20:22,864
but this guy's smart,
so we could only track him so far.

946
01:20:23,031 --> 01:20:25,408
He seems to know all the city's blind spots.

947
01:20:25,575 --> 01:20:26,868
See, we lost him somewhere in here,

948
01:20:27,035 --> 01:20:28,203
which means he could be anywhere

949
01:20:28,286 --> 01:20:29,996
within that half-a-mile radius.

950
01:20:30,163 --> 01:20:33,083
Maybe if we cross-reference
phone records, leases...

951
01:20:33,249 --> 01:20:35,293
No, this has got Shaw's name
written all over it.

952
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:37,587
We've got vantage points,
multiple exits,

953
01:20:37,671 --> 01:20:39,214
subways, highways
and storm drains.

954
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:40,882
Bad-ass and brains.

955
01:20:40,965 --> 01:20:43,009
Woman, you keep that up,
I'm going to be out of a job.

956
01:20:43,426 --> 01:20:46,012
All right, let's go nail that son of a bitch.

957
01:21:09,828 --> 01:21:10,870
They're long gone.

958
01:21:11,413 --> 01:21:13,498
There's nothing here.

959
01:21:21,589 --> 01:21:23,049
There's never nothing.

960
01:21:31,141 --> 01:21:33,268
There's always something.

961
01:21:39,566 --> 01:21:41,067
Let's go, guys.

962
01:21:42,777 --> 01:21:46,948
Shaw, everyone is in place.
All things moving according to plan.

963
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:52,162
Good. Send him in.

964
01:21:55,457 --> 01:21:57,417
Yo, it's Hobbs.

965
01:21:58,835 --> 01:22:01,087
What have you got, Parker?
Give me something good.

966
01:22:01,254 --> 01:22:04,841
Yeah, that paint you got from Shaw's place
is highly specialized.

967
01:22:05,008 --> 01:22:07,177
Anti-thermal low-IR coating.

968
01:22:07,344 --> 01:22:09,304
-Military.
-Exactly.

969
01:22:09,471 --> 01:22:12,140
We got a list of bases around Europe
that use this paint type

970
01:22:12,307 --> 01:22:13,475
and those specific colors.

971
01:22:13,641 --> 01:22:14,976
All right,
let's cross-reference that

972
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:16,853
with all of Shaw's
military targets.

973
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:19,314
I guaran-damn-tee you
one of them is gonna match.

974
01:22:20,690 --> 01:22:24,027
Bingo.
It's a NATO base in Spain.

975
01:22:24,194 --> 01:22:25,653
That puts Shaw in a different country.

976
01:22:26,112 --> 01:22:27,614
That means he's got an eight-hour lead on us.

977
01:22:27,781 --> 01:22:29,949
We gotta move now.
Tej, give me that info.

978
01:22:30,283 --> 01:22:32,452
Riley and I will go ahead
and we're going to lock down the base.

979
01:22:32,619 --> 01:22:34,704
We're going to protect
that component personally.

980
01:22:34,871 --> 01:22:37,582
Toretto, I'll arrange transportation for you
and your cars.

981
01:22:37,749 --> 01:22:41,544
You brush up on your Spanish, boys.
I'll see you  en España.

982
01:23:04,067 --> 01:23:06,986
You son of a bitch! You made it!

983
01:23:07,529 --> 01:23:08,863
-What up, man?
-Good to see you.

984
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:11,408
Good to see you.
So, what's going on here?

985
01:23:11,574 --> 01:23:13,368
Figured out they're hitting an army base
in Spain.

986
01:23:13,535 --> 01:23:16,204
Border patrol ID'ed Shaw's men
crossing through last night.

987
01:23:16,371 --> 01:23:18,456
Hobbs and Riley went
to lock down the base.

988
01:23:18,623 --> 01:23:20,041
- They're going to meet us there.
- Where's Dom?

989
01:23:20,208 --> 01:23:21,960
He wasn't going without you.

990
01:23:28,174 --> 01:23:30,218
I found out what happened to Letty.

991
01:23:31,052 --> 01:23:33,096
It's all my fault.

992
01:23:34,097 --> 01:23:35,223
Brian,

993
01:23:36,141 --> 01:23:39,477
whatever you found out,
that's for you.

994
01:23:40,061 --> 01:23:42,022
What we're about to do now

995
01:23:43,481 --> 01:23:45,316
is for her.

996
01:23:48,737 --> 01:23:50,780
We've got four teams on overwatch,

997
01:23:50,947 --> 01:23:53,742
sniper-spotters in roosts
north and south of the target.

998
01:23:53,908 --> 01:23:55,410
Just keep all your men out of sight.

999
01:23:55,493 --> 01:23:56,578
When they drive that truck in here,

1000
01:23:56,661 --> 01:23:59,289
I want to come crashing down on them
like the walls of Jericho.

1001
01:23:59,456 --> 01:24:03,960
Hobbs, I just caught this one disabling
the perimeter security system.

1002
01:24:04,127 --> 01:24:06,338
-Your house is compromised.
-What are you suggesting?

1003
01:24:06,504 --> 01:24:07,547
I ain't suggesting.

1004
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:09,841
We follow protocol,
we move the component out.

1005
01:24:10,008 --> 01:24:12,844
Shaw thinks it's here. We're going to get it
out of here before he arrives.

1006
01:24:13,011 --> 01:24:14,888
Stealth and speed are going to
be our two best friends.

1007
01:24:14,971 --> 01:24:17,140
We're going to protect our little egg,
move it out of the henhouse,

1008
01:24:17,307 --> 01:24:20,560
then we're going to wait
for that goddamn fox to arrive.

1009
01:24:23,646 --> 01:24:26,441
I just got word
they caught one of Shaw's men at the base.

1010
01:24:26,608 --> 01:24:27,734
It's time.

1011
01:24:27,901 --> 01:24:31,529
Something is not right.
He wanted us to find that guy.

1012
01:24:31,696 --> 01:24:34,574
Think about it.
At Interpol, you were face-to-face with him.

1013
01:24:35,325 --> 01:24:36,493
Brian,
so what are you saying?

1014
01:24:37,077 --> 01:24:42,082
Braga said the only way you get near Shaw
is if he wants you to.

1015
01:24:42,749 --> 01:24:44,542
Tej, where's that component?

1016
01:24:44,959 --> 01:24:46,544
They're moving it
to a secure location.

1017
01:24:51,591 --> 01:24:53,259
Shaw ain't hitting that base.

1018
01:24:53,426 --> 01:24:54,636
He's hitting the convoy.

1019
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:31,172
Let's go!

1020
01:25:59,909 --> 01:26:01,995
We've got a report,
the convoy's under attack.

1021
01:26:02,078 --> 01:26:03,121
Get a chopper, now!

1022
01:26:19,763 --> 01:26:22,182
Fellas, you better hurry up.
They just took the convoy.

1023
01:26:25,769 --> 01:26:27,103
And Dom,

1024
01:26:27,354 --> 01:26:28,855
Letty's with them.

1025
01:26:29,606 --> 01:26:31,941
We stick to the plan.

1026
01:26:38,615 --> 01:26:39,657
All right,
you heard the man.

1027
01:26:39,783 --> 01:26:40,950
Let's play this fast and clean.

1028
01:26:41,034 --> 01:26:42,035
That thing's heading your way.

1029
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,408
All systems go.

1030
01:27:21,574 --> 01:27:23,576
Everything looks stable.

1031
01:27:24,244 --> 01:27:26,413
Uh, guys,
we gotta come up with another plan.

1032
01:27:29,749 --> 01:27:30,750
They got a tank.

1033
01:27:30,917 --> 01:27:33,336
I'm sorry, did somebody just say "a tank"?

1034
01:27:39,592 --> 01:27:40,844
We got company, guys.

1035
01:27:41,011 --> 01:27:43,263
Toretto is coming right at you.

1036
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:46,057
Okay. Get the weapons hot.

1037
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,602
Give me satellite imaging.

1038
01:28:43,615 --> 01:28:45,408
Straight ahead of us.

1039
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:47,619
There you are.

1040
01:29:02,467 --> 01:29:03,802
Who's got a plan B?

1041
01:29:03,968 --> 01:29:06,513
Plan B?
We need a plan C, D, E.

1042
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:07,847
We need more alphabets!

1043
01:29:08,014 --> 01:29:11,142
Hey, we do
what we do best.

1044
01:29:11,309 --> 01:29:12,769
We improvise, all right?

1045
01:29:29,035 --> 01:29:32,038
Okay, Jah.
Take it to the other side.

1046
01:29:32,205 --> 01:29:33,540
Let's have some fun.

1047
01:29:49,389 --> 01:29:51,975
What the hell is wrong with you?
This isn't part of the plan.

1048
01:30:04,696 --> 01:30:06,740
Take their attention
away from the people!

1049
01:30:19,919 --> 01:30:21,713
Shaw, you don't have to do this.

1050
01:30:32,766 --> 01:30:34,434
We got one right
in front of us.

1051
01:30:34,768 --> 01:30:35,852
Boom.

1052
01:30:37,729 --> 01:30:38,772
Oh, shit!

1053
01:30:46,071 --> 01:30:47,447
You lucky bastard.

1054
01:30:48,573 --> 01:30:50,200
Roman, you hang in there.

1055
01:30:50,367 --> 01:30:51,951
Hang in there, man!

1056
01:30:55,372 --> 01:30:59,042
Somebody better do something!
I got a tank on my ass!

1057
01:31:01,378 --> 01:31:02,962
There's gotta be
a break up ahead.

1058
01:31:07,467 --> 01:31:08,593
Oh, look,

1059
01:31:09,594 --> 01:31:10,637
a bridge.

1060
01:31:40,792 --> 01:31:41,835
Screw it.

1061
01:32:12,991 --> 01:32:14,617
- Yeah!

1062
01:32:18,038 --> 01:32:19,873
We're dragging a car behind us.

1063
01:32:21,332 --> 01:32:24,002
Brian, that Mustang would
make a nice anchor.

1064
01:32:24,169 --> 01:32:25,337
Yeah, I'm on it.

1065
01:32:50,570 --> 01:32:51,571
Damn!

1066
01:32:51,738 --> 01:32:53,490
Shaw, we've got to
get rid of that car.

1067
01:32:53,656 --> 01:32:56,201
Letty, go take care
of the cable.

1068
01:33:11,758 --> 01:33:12,842
Yeah!

1069
01:33:15,595 --> 01:33:16,930
What's she doing?

1070
01:33:17,097 --> 01:33:18,264
Shit!

1071
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:20,600
Okay, Toretto.

1072
01:33:23,395 --> 01:33:24,437
Here's your girl...

1073
01:33:27,565 --> 01:33:29,150
And your happy ending.

1074
01:33:29,317 --> 01:33:30,485
Letty!

1075
01:34:05,812 --> 01:34:08,314
Jesus Christ.

1076
01:34:15,697 --> 01:34:17,824
I can't believe they
stole a 70-ton tank

1077
01:34:17,991 --> 01:34:19,284
for a three-ounce
computer chip.

1078
01:34:19,451 --> 01:34:23,329
That 3-ounce computer chip
is more deadly than 1,000 of those tanks.

1079
01:34:26,875 --> 01:34:28,501
What about her?

1080
01:34:29,002 --> 01:34:30,670
Not her.

1081
01:34:30,837 --> 01:34:32,297
She was working with Shaw.

1082
01:34:32,464 --> 01:34:33,548
Was,

1083
01:34:35,675 --> 01:34:37,677
but she's always
been one of us.

1084
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:42,640
Let's give them a minute.

1085
01:34:56,571 --> 01:34:58,531
Let's go process Shaw and his crew.

1086
01:34:58,698 --> 01:35:01,868
I've never looked more forward to
filling out paperwork in my life.

1087
01:35:18,593 --> 01:35:19,886
Hey.

1088
01:35:23,223 --> 01:35:26,559
Look, I don't even know
how to say this to you,

1089
01:35:31,272 --> 01:35:33,566
but everything that's happened here
is because of me.

1090
01:35:34,234 --> 01:35:35,568
I'm the one that put you undercover...

1091
01:35:35,735 --> 01:35:37,404
Stop.

1092
01:35:38,405 --> 01:35:40,073
I may not remember anything,

1093
01:35:41,324 --> 01:35:44,077
but I know one thing about myself.

1094
01:35:44,411 --> 01:35:47,622
Nobody makes me do anything
I don't want to.

1095
01:36:00,051 --> 01:36:03,179
So, what's our next adventure after this?

1096
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:08,810
How about we stay in one place?

1097
01:36:09,644 --> 01:36:10,812
Where are you thinking?

1098
01:36:11,021 --> 01:36:12,522
Tokyo.

1099
01:36:13,231 --> 01:36:15,608
We always talk about Tokyo.

1100
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:19,279
Tokyo it is.

1101
01:36:25,744 --> 01:36:28,455
Can I ask you something?

1102
01:36:36,379 --> 01:36:40,633
How did you know that there would
be a car there to break our fall?

1103
01:36:41,468 --> 01:36:42,969
I didn't.

1104
01:36:46,931 --> 01:36:50,518
Some things you just
have to take on faith.

1105
01:36:52,187 --> 01:36:53,605
Hey, Toretto!

1106
01:36:53,772 --> 01:36:55,482
You need to hear this.

1107
01:37:09,329 --> 01:37:12,332
You guys really
think you've won.

1108
01:37:13,333 --> 01:37:14,959
This code you live by,

1109
01:37:15,835 --> 01:37:19,005
it's the very reason
why you weren't even in the game.

1110
01:37:21,675 --> 01:37:25,011
I told you exactly what I was gonna do
if you didn't walk away, Toretto.

1111
01:37:26,054 --> 01:37:27,138
Go!

1112
01:37:27,972 --> 01:37:29,516
But you didn't listen.

1113
01:37:30,350 --> 01:37:34,562
I told you I can reach out
and break you whenever I want.

1114
01:37:37,148 --> 01:37:38,817
And I have.

1115
01:37:38,858 --> 01:37:39,984
Come on.

1116
01:37:43,029 --> 01:37:44,239
-Go.
-No!

1117
01:37:44,406 --> 01:37:46,574
Maybe you should call Mia.

1118
01:38:00,255 --> 01:38:01,756
-Mia?
-Brian!

1119
01:38:05,218 --> 01:38:06,553
Let me go!

1120
01:38:19,858 --> 01:38:22,569
So, this is how it's gonna go down.

1121
01:38:23,111 --> 01:38:25,071
You're gonna cut me loose from these cuffs,

1122
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:26,781
you're gonna hand me the chip,

1123
01:38:26,948 --> 01:38:28,950
I'm gonna walk out of here
and you're not gonna follow.

1124
01:38:29,117 --> 01:38:31,286
You must be joking.

1125
01:38:35,290 --> 01:38:36,541
Look at his face.

1126
01:38:40,545 --> 01:38:41,921
Ask him if I'm joking.

1127
01:38:42,088 --> 01:38:46,801
One hostage does not outweigh
the threat to millions.

1128
01:38:47,886 --> 01:38:51,639
I'm sorry,
but this changes nothing.

1129
01:38:56,728 --> 01:38:58,063
It changes everything.

1130
01:38:59,439 --> 01:39:02,150
You tell your men to stand down.

1131
01:39:04,944 --> 01:39:06,780
Stand down.

1132
01:39:09,074 --> 01:39:10,116
Toretto,

1133
01:39:11,117 --> 01:39:12,327
I need you to know,

1134
01:39:12,619 --> 01:39:16,081
the moment we let him
walk out that door with that chip,

1135
01:39:16,247 --> 01:39:19,292
words like "amnesty" and "pardon"

1136
01:39:19,459 --> 01:39:21,127
walk out with him.

1137
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:30,637
Those words went out
the day we were born.

1138
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,668
Coming, babe?

1139
01:40:07,173 --> 01:40:08,508
Of course.

1140
01:40:10,343 --> 01:40:12,012
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

1141
01:40:15,765 --> 01:40:17,434
Like I said,

1142
01:40:18,935 --> 01:40:21,271
you were never in the game.

1143
01:40:22,063 --> 01:40:26,151
If I see you on the horizon,
I'll make the call and the girl's dead.

1144
01:40:39,372 --> 01:40:41,458
So, what about Toretto's sister?

1145
01:40:43,293 --> 01:40:45,045
There's no need for her anymore.

1146
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:53,470
I just jammed every signal
up and down the spectrum.

1147
01:40:55,722 --> 01:40:57,390
Let's move.

1148
01:40:57,557 --> 01:40:59,893
I'm coming with you.

1149
01:41:33,009 --> 01:41:34,928
Where the hell does this dude
think he's going?

1150
01:41:35,095 --> 01:41:36,930
We're on an army base,
he's trapped.

1151
01:41:45,438 --> 01:41:47,691
Wow, you just had
to open your mouth.

1152
01:41:47,982 --> 01:41:49,984
Now we got a big-ass plane to deal with.

1153
01:41:50,151 --> 01:41:52,320
That ain't a plane. That's a planet.

1154
01:42:09,295 --> 01:42:13,133
She's as good as dead
if Shaw gets away on that plane.

1155
01:42:16,886 --> 01:42:18,805
Then we don't let him get away.

1156
01:42:26,479 --> 01:42:28,648
Let's end this thing.

1157
01:42:37,198 --> 01:42:38,450
Ride or die.

1158
01:42:39,534 --> 01:42:40,618
Ride or die.

1159
01:44:06,246 --> 01:44:07,622
Tell them to take off!

1160
01:44:18,466 --> 01:44:19,759
Babe, get me under the wing.

1161
01:44:19,926 --> 01:44:22,429
If I can hit that flap,
we can keep it from taking off.

1162
01:44:27,434 --> 01:44:28,601
You be careful.

1163
01:44:29,602 --> 01:44:31,438
This is who we are.

1164
01:44:43,616 --> 01:44:44,617
Shit!

1165
01:44:48,288 --> 01:44:49,289
Grab the wheel!

1166
01:45:39,005 --> 01:45:40,048
Dom!

1167
01:45:47,389 --> 01:45:48,473
Go!

1168
01:45:48,682 --> 01:45:49,974
Come on. Let's go.

1169
01:46:06,199 --> 01:46:07,325
Get in the car.

1170
01:47:38,124 --> 01:47:39,125
Whoo!

1171
01:49:09,424 --> 01:49:11,009
What happened?
Did you hit the flap?

1172
01:49:11,551 --> 01:49:12,594
Uh...

1173
01:49:13,386 --> 01:49:14,763
You should buckle up right now.

1174
01:49:14,888 --> 01:49:15,930
What?

1175
01:49:31,780 --> 01:49:32,864
Hey!

1176
01:49:36,951 --> 01:49:38,078
Wrong team, bitch.

1177
01:50:21,413 --> 01:50:22,455
Shit.

1178
01:50:43,476 --> 01:50:44,477
Yeah!

1179
01:51:00,827 --> 01:51:02,162
I got you.

1180
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:11,564
Tej!

1181
01:52:11,981 --> 01:52:13,066
Keep her steady!

1182
01:52:13,733 --> 01:52:15,652
-We gotta move, it's going down!
-Go!

1183
01:52:20,365 --> 01:52:22,075
Go, now!

1184
01:52:25,370 --> 01:52:27,330
Come on, let's move, move, move!

1185
01:52:33,586 --> 01:52:34,587
Come on!

1186
01:52:38,675 --> 01:52:40,010
Dom!

1187
01:55:45,111 --> 01:55:46,738
Where's Gisele?

1188
01:55:50,742 --> 01:55:52,577
Where's Gisele?

1189
01:56:21,648 --> 01:56:24,734
So this is worth billions, huh?

1190
01:56:29,239 --> 01:56:30,657
Yes, it is.

1191
01:56:35,453 --> 01:56:36,746
Name your price, Dom.

1192
01:56:41,668 --> 01:56:44,129
1327.

1193
01:57:10,113 --> 01:57:11,865
Don't burn it this time. Please?

1194
01:57:12,032 --> 01:57:14,367
I never go and burn it, man.

1195
01:57:16,536 --> 01:57:18,121
Good food.

1196
01:57:18,621 --> 01:57:22,792
The air quality here is lousy, the traffic is bad,

1197
01:57:23,543 --> 01:57:25,211
but I think you'll learn to like this place.

1198
01:57:25,378 --> 01:57:27,881
Yeah, and here you've
got your own garage

1199
01:57:28,006 --> 01:57:30,008
so you can build a car with Daddy.

1200
01:57:30,050 --> 01:57:31,176
We'll be building a car?

1201
01:57:31,217 --> 01:57:33,720
First car better be a Charger, Jack.

1202
01:57:34,721 --> 01:57:36,014
You mean Skyline.

1203
01:57:37,223 --> 01:57:39,392
Like I said, he's a Toretto.

1204
01:57:39,726 --> 01:57:41,061
You're confusing the kid.

1205
01:57:41,227 --> 01:57:42,395
Mia, you're gonna let him
get away with this?

1206
01:57:42,562 --> 01:57:43,980
You're really going to do it?

1207
01:57:44,814 --> 01:57:45,857
Tokyo.

1208
01:57:47,067 --> 01:57:49,736
Yeah, it's just something I gotta do.

1209
01:57:49,903 --> 01:57:53,239
You know we got your back,
whenever you need us.

1210
01:57:57,327 --> 01:57:59,746
Hey, Mia, you better hide your baby oil.

1211
01:57:59,829 --> 01:58:00,872
I'm just playing.

1212
01:58:00,914 --> 01:58:02,582
- You better hide that big-ass forehead.

1213
01:58:02,749 --> 01:58:04,000
I was just joking, but whatever.

1214
01:58:04,501 --> 01:58:05,919
Definitely not that funny.

1215
01:58:06,086 --> 01:58:07,754
It's official.

1216
01:58:07,921 --> 01:58:09,089
You're all free.

1217
01:58:09,172 --> 01:58:10,548
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

1218
01:58:13,093 --> 01:58:15,595
It wasn't half bad,
having you work for me.

1219
01:58:17,931 --> 01:58:20,266
We all know you were working for me, Hobbs.

1220
01:58:20,934 --> 01:58:23,228
Agree to disagree.

1221
01:58:23,395 --> 01:58:24,437
Thank you.

1222
01:58:25,397 --> 01:58:26,606
Good luck.

1223
01:58:28,274 --> 01:58:29,275
Elena?

1224
01:58:29,442 --> 01:58:30,527
Letty.

1225
01:58:30,610 --> 01:58:32,612
This is gonna be awkward.

1226
01:58:33,113 --> 01:58:35,281
-But sexy as hell.
-Sexy as hell.

1227
01:58:35,949 --> 01:58:38,952
I wanted to thank you
for everything you've done for him.

1228
01:58:39,411 --> 01:58:40,745
For us.

1229
01:58:41,287 --> 01:58:43,289
It takes an amazing woman.

1230
01:58:45,250 --> 01:58:46,793
He's an amazing guy.

1231
01:58:47,460 --> 01:58:48,962
Yeah, he is.

1232
01:58:50,463 --> 01:58:52,757
Try to keep him out of trouble, huh?

1233
01:58:54,134 --> 01:58:56,720
Now, you know that's not gonna happen.

1234
01:58:57,637 --> 01:58:58,805
I know.

1235
01:59:01,766 --> 01:59:04,102
Not bad for a cop.

1236
01:59:11,693 --> 01:59:14,529
I never thought I'd trust a criminal.

1237
01:59:17,198 --> 01:59:18,950
Until next time.

1238
01:59:19,534 --> 01:59:22,287
Until next time.

1239
01:59:28,710 --> 01:59:29,753
Elena.

1240
01:59:38,636 --> 01:59:40,055
You know you don't have to go.

1241
01:59:43,058 --> 01:59:46,519
All this... This is your family.

1242
01:59:47,562 --> 01:59:49,397
It's who you are.

1243
01:59:49,814 --> 01:59:51,733
This is my family.

1244
01:59:54,027 --> 01:59:55,862
This is who I am.

1245
02:00:14,089 --> 02:00:15,340
All right, everybody, let's eat.

1246
02:00:15,757 --> 02:00:16,800
Want some help with that?

1247
02:00:17,008 --> 02:00:18,551
It's all here, it's done.

1248
02:00:19,386 --> 02:00:21,721
Come on, man, let's get with it.

1249
02:00:24,599 --> 02:00:26,267
First bite, he's got grace.

1250
02:00:26,434 --> 02:00:28,103
House rules, man. House rules.

1251
02:00:30,522 --> 02:00:33,108
Any of this feel familiar to you?

1252
02:00:37,237 --> 02:00:38,780
No.

1253
02:00:41,408 --> 02:00:43,535
But it feels like home.

1254
02:00:44,369 --> 02:00:45,704
That's good enough for me.

1255
02:00:46,496 --> 02:00:48,998
All right, y'all.
Come on, let's do this.

1256
02:00:49,874 --> 02:00:51,584
- Okay, Roman,

1257
02:00:53,294 --> 02:00:55,088
bless our table.

1258
02:01:00,719 --> 02:01:03,972
Father, thank you for
the gathering of friends.

1259
02:01:04,139 --> 02:01:06,933
Father, we give thanks
for all the choices we've made,

1260
02:01:07,100 --> 02:01:09,686
because that's what
makes us who we are.

1261
02:01:09,853 --> 02:01:13,565
Let us forever cherish the loved ones
we've lost along the way.

1262
02:01:13,732 --> 02:01:15,275
Thank you for the little angel,

1263
02:01:15,358 --> 02:01:17,318
the newest addition to our family.

1264
02:01:17,485 --> 02:01:19,320
Thank you for bringing Letty home.

1265
02:01:19,487 --> 02:01:23,158
And most of all, thank you for fast cars.

1266
02:02:57,836 --> 02:03:00,088
Dominic Toretto.

1267
02:03:00,255 --> 02:03:01,464
You don't know me,
