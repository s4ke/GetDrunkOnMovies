2
00:02:01,644 --> 00:02:03,801
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

3
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:06,057
Tell them we wish
to board at once.

4
00:02:07,563 --> 00:02:08,973
With all due respect...

5
00:02:09,105 --> 00:02:12,306
the ambassadors for the supreme
chancellor wish to board immediately.

6
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,312
Yes, of course.

7
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:17,523
As you know,
our blockade isperfectly legal...

8
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:21,728
and we'd be happy
to receive the ambassadors.

9
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,824
I'm TC-1 4 at your service.

10
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:48,829
This way, please.

11
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,994
We are greatly honoured
by your visit, Ambassadors.

12
00:02:58,128 --> 00:03:00,000
Make yourselves comfortable.

13
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:02,453
My master
will be with you shortly.

14
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:08,628
I have a bad feeling about this.

15
00:03:08,758 --> 00:03:11,757
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

16
00:03:11,885 --> 00:03:15,797
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

17
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:18,298
Don't centre on your anxieties,
Obi-Wan.

18
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,548
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

19
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:24,514
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

20
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:26,632
But not at the expense
of the moment.

21
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:29,682
Be mindful of the living  force,
young Padawan.

22
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,718
Yes, Master.

23
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:37,553
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

24
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:39,810
These Federation types are cowards.

25
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,773
The negotiations will be short.

26
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,186
What? What did you say?

27
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,270
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

28
00:03:50,028 --> 00:03:51,225
I knew it.

29
00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:53,602
They're here to  force a settlement.

30
00:03:54,947 --> 00:03:58,029
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

31
00:03:58,157 --> 00:03:59,733
Are you brain-dead?

32
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:02,699
I'm not going in there
with two  Jedi.

33
00:04:04,368 --> 00:04:05,778
Send a droid.

34
00:04:11,246 --> 00:04:13,118
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

35
00:04:13,247 --> 00:04:15,534
No. I sense
an unusual amount of fear...

36
00:04:15,665 --> 00:04:17,786
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

37
00:04:28,713 --> 00:04:30,585
What is it?

38
00:04:30,714 --> 00:04:33,381
This scheme of yours has failed,
Lord Sidious.

39
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:37,039
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these  Jedi.

40
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:41,964
Viceroy, I don't want
this stuntedslime in my sight again.

41
00:04:43,345 --> 00:04:47,387
This turn of events is unfortunate.
We must accelerate our plans.

42
00:04:47,513 --> 00:04:50,049
Begin landing your troops.

43
00:04:50,181 --> 00:04:53,879
My lord, is that legal?

44
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:56,303
I will make it legal.

45
00:04:56,434 --> 00:04:58,721
And the  Jedi?

46
00:04:58,852 --> 00:05:01,341
The chancellor should never have
brought them into this.

47
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:03,220
Kill them immediately.

48
00:05:03,354 --> 00:05:07,645
Yes, my lord.
As you wish.

49
00:05:09,524 --> 00:05:11,314
Captain, look!

50
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:13,816
Shields--

51
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:19,191
Sorry.

52
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,818
Dioxis.

53
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:30,271
They must be dead by now.

54
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:33,076
Destroy what's left ofthem.

55
00:05:41,205 --> 00:05:43,575
Oh! Excuse me.

56
00:05:43,706 --> 00:05:46,658
-Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
-Roger, roger.

57
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,284
Uh-oh. Blast them.

58
00:05:55,045 --> 00:05:56,586
What is going on down there?

59
00:05:56,713 --> 00:05:58,669
We lost the transmission, sir.

60
00:06:03,174 --> 00:06:06,173
Have you ever encountered
a  Jedi knight before, sir?

61
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,252
Well, no, but I don't--
Seal off the bridge.

62
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:12,088
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

63
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,176
I want droidekas
up here at once!

64
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:16,840
We will not survive this.

65
00:06:28,394 --> 00:06:29,804
Close the blast doors!

66
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,597
That will hold them.

67
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,773
They are still coming through.

68
00:06:49,904 --> 00:06:51,812
This is impossible!

69
00:06:56,324 --> 00:06:59,157
Where are those droidekas?

70
00:07:00,743 --> 00:07:02,485
Master! Destroyers!

71
00:07:08,913 --> 00:07:10,287
They have shield generators!

72
00:07:11,748 --> 00:07:14,451
It's a standoff.
Let's go.

73
00:07:18,626 --> 00:07:21,115
They're no match for droidekas.

74
00:07:21,252 --> 00:07:22,911
Sir!

75
00:07:23,045 --> 00:07:25,712
They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.

76
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:37,176
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

77
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:41,594
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

78
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,802
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

79
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,471
Let's split up.

80
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:49,799
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

81
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:51,758
You were right
about one thing, Master.

82
00:07:53,726 --> 00:07:56,393
The negotiations were short.

83
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,967
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.

84
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,178
It's Queen Amidala herself.

85
00:08:02,313 --> 00:08:04,719
At last we are getting results.

86
00:08:06,107 --> 00:08:09,106
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

87
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:12,315
You will not be so pleased when you hear
what l have tosay, Viceroy.

88
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:16,141
Your trade boycott
of our planet has ended.

89
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:18,814
I was not aware of such failure.

90
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:21,649
I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...

91
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:24,484
and thatyou have been commanded
to reach settlement.

92
00:08:24,616 --> 00:08:26,856
I know nothing
of any ambassadors.

93
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:29,362
You must be mistaken.

94
00:08:29,493 --> 00:08:31,484
Beware, Viceroy.

95
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:34,322
The Federation
hasgone too farthis time.

96
00:08:34,454 --> 00:08:38,496
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

97
00:08:38,622 --> 00:08:41,111
You assume too much.

98
00:08:41,248 --> 00:08:42,622
We will see.

99
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,245
- She's right. The senate will never--
- It's too late now.

100
00:08:48,377 --> 00:08:51,329
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

101
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:55,789
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

102
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,046
Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?

103
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:07,333
How could that be true?

104
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:11,796
I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.

105
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,676
It must-- handiwork--
negotiate--ambassadors--

106
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:18,425
-nobody would--
- Senator Palpatine.

107
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,430
What's happening?

108
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,431
Check the transmission generator.

109
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,385
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

110
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,807
The Federation
would not dare go that far.

111
00:09:29,938 --> 00:09:33,719
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be finished.

112
00:09:33,857 --> 00:09:36,690
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.

113
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:40,017
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

114
00:09:40,151 --> 00:09:42,475
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?

115
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,274
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.

116
00:09:46,404 --> 00:09:48,478
Our security volunteers
will be no match...

117
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:50,734
against a battle-hardened
Federation army.

118
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:56,022
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

119
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:35,549
- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship...

120
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,798
and there is no trace of the  Jedi.

121
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,678
They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.

122
00:10:40,805 --> 00:10:43,259
If they're down here, sir,
we'll find them.

123
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:47,716
Use caution.
These  Jedi are not to be underestimated.

124
00:11:01,523 --> 00:11:03,313
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

125
00:11:04,232 --> 00:11:06,140
Get down!

126
00:11:16,155 --> 00:11:19,024
Was'n dat?
Hey, wait!

127
00:11:19,948 --> 00:11:21,690
Oh, mooie-mooie,
I love you.

128
00:11:21,824 --> 00:11:23,862
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

129
00:11:23,992 --> 00:11:25,615
I spake.

130
00:11:25,743 --> 00:11:27,864
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

131
00:11:27,994 --> 00:11:30,863
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

132
00:11:30,995 --> 00:11:34,029
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

133
00:11:34,163 --> 00:11:36,237
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.

134
00:11:36,373 --> 00:11:39,242
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

135
00:11:39,374 --> 00:11:41,282
- Oh, no!
- Stay down!

136
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:51,371
You saved my again.

137
00:11:51,505 --> 00:11:53,377
- What's this?
- A local.

138
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:56,042
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

139
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:59,541
More?
"More" did you spake?

140
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:04,548
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

141
00:12:04,678 --> 00:12:07,879
Is where I grew up.
'Tis a hidden city.

142
00:12:09,513 --> 00:12:11,385
- A city?
- Uh-huh.

143
00:12:11,514 --> 00:12:13,304
Can you take us there?

144
00:12:13,849 --> 00:12:15,639
On second thought, no.

145
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:18,255
- Not really, no.
- No?

146
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:20,513
'Tis embarrassing...

147
00:12:20,643 --> 00:12:24,590
but my afraid
my've been banished.

148
00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:27,811
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.

149
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:30,973
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.

150
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:34,106
- You hear that?
- Yah.

151
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:37,979
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

152
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,682
If they find us,
they will crush us...

153
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:45,360
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

154
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:47,195
Oh.

155
00:12:47,323 --> 00:12:49,397
Yousa point is well seen.

156
00:12:49,532 --> 00:12:51,856
Dis way. Hurry!

157
00:12:57,161 --> 00:13:00,444
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

158
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,451
Ah, my warning you.

159
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,705
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

160
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:10,163
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.

161
00:13:20,588 --> 00:13:22,994
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?

162
00:14:08,277 --> 00:14:11,192

How wude.

169
00:14:56,425 --> 00:14:58,831
Yousa cannot bees hair.

170
00:14:58,968 --> 00:15:03,508
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

171
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:08,510
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

172
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,219
Wesa no like da Naboo.

173
00:15:12,349 --> 00:15:15,134
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

174
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:18,182
Day tink day brains so big.

175
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:22,435
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control ofyou.

176
00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:24,849
Mesa no tink so.

177
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,849
Day not know of uss-en.

178
00:15:27,982 --> 00:15:30,897
You and the Naboo form
a symbiont circle.

179
00:15:31,025 --> 00:15:34,392
What happens to one ofyou will affect
the other. You must understand this.

180
00:15:34,526 --> 00:15:39,315
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

181
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:41,981
Then speed us on our way.

182
00:15:42,113 --> 00:15:44,602
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

183
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,525
We could use a transport.

184
00:15:47,658 --> 00:15:50,491
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

185
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:53,699
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

186
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:58,533
'tis goen through the planet core.

187
00:15:58,663 --> 00:16:00,535
Now...

188
00:16:00,664 --> 00:16:02,454
go.

189
00:16:02,581 --> 00:16:04,821
Thankyou foryour help.
We leave in peace.

190
00:16:04,957 --> 00:16:06,995
Master, what's a bongo?

191
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,081
A transport, I hope.

192
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:11,283
Deysa setten yousa up.

193
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:15,035
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

194
00:16:16,546 --> 00:16:19,331
Any help here would be hot.

195
00:16:20,673 --> 00:16:22,545
Master, we're short on time.

196
00:16:23,675 --> 00:16:26,294
We'll need a navigator to get us
through the planet's core.

197
00:16:26,426 --> 00:16:28,382
This Gungan may be of help.

198
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:33,545
What is to become
ofJarJar Binks here?

199
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,587
Hisen to be pune-ished.

200
00:16:39,515 --> 00:16:40,889
I saved his life.

201
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:43,505
He owes me
what you call a "Iife-debt."

202
00:16:43,642 --> 00:16:47,471
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

203
00:16:47,603 --> 00:16:49,927
Binks...

204
00:16:50,062 --> 00:16:54,009
yousa havena liveplay
with thisen hisen?

205
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:02,600
Begone wit him!

206
00:17:05,278 --> 00:17:07,648
Count me outta dis one.

207
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:10,897
Better dead here
than dead in da core.

208
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,148
Yee gods!
What mesa sayin?

209
00:17:32,374 --> 00:17:35,159
Dis is nutsen.
Oh, gooberfish!

210
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:38,540
- Why were you banished,JarJar?
- It's a longo tale-o...

211
00:17:38,668 --> 00:17:43,706
buta a small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.

212
00:17:43,837 --> 00:17:48,626
- You were banished for being clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

213
00:18:01,554 --> 00:18:05,763
Mesa caused mabee one two-y
lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

214
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:07,927
Yud-say boom da gasser...

215

00:18:18,103 --> 00:18:20,177
Big gooberfish!
Huge-o teeth!

217
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:35,027
- There's always a bigger fish.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

218
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:49,609
The invasion is on schedule,
my lord.

219
00:18:49,743 --> 00:18:52,742
Ihave thesenate
boggeddown inprocedures.

220
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:57,280
They willhave no choice but
to acceptyourcontrolofthesystem.

221
00:18:57,414 --> 00:19:02,120
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

222
00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:05,201
QueenAmidala isyoungandnaive.

223
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:08,783
You will findcontrollingher
willnotbe difficult.

224
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:10,791
Yes, my lord.

225
00:19:12,254 --> 00:19:15,123
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.

226
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:19,748
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

227
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,958
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The  force will guide us.

228
00:19:28,095 --> 00:19:30,880
Oh, maxi big, da  force.

229
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:33,796
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

230
00:19:35,181 --> 00:19:37,551
- We're losing power.
- Oh, no!

231
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:45,759
Wesa dyin' here.

232
00:19:45,895 --> 00:19:48,562
-Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet"?

233
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,640
Monsters out dare.
Leak'n in here.

234
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:56,728
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

235
00:19:58,026 --> 00:20:00,313
Power's back.

236
00:20:00,443 --> 00:20:02,517
Monster's back!

237
00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:12,107
Relax.

238
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:13,698
You overdid it.

239
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,496
Head for that outcropping.

240
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,533
Oh, boy.

241
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,925
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

242
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,727
Ah, victory.

243
00:21:28,235 --> 00:21:30,392
Dis'n loverly.

244
00:21:36,572 --> 00:21:38,896
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

245
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:43,192
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.

246
00:21:43,325 --> 00:21:46,490
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

247
00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:50,067
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

248
00:21:50,203 --> 00:21:54,328
In time, your people's suffering will
persuade you to see our point ofview.

249
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:57,572
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

250
00:21:57,707 --> 00:21:59,330
Process them.

251
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,248
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

252
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,998
Roger, roger.

253
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,065
We should leave the street,
Your Highness.

254
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:01,818
Get their weapons.

255
00:23:03,655 --> 00:23:05,895
Yousa guys bombad!

256
00:23:07,532 --> 00:23:09,902
We're ambassadors
for the supreme chancellor.

257
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:11,905
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

258
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:13,859
The negotiations
never took place.

259
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:16,363
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

260
00:23:16,494 --> 00:23:18,568
They've knocked out
all our communications.

261
00:23:18,703 --> 00:23:22,034
- Do you have transports?
- In the main hangar. This way.

262
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:30,081
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

263
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:33,741
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

264
00:23:33,877 --> 00:23:36,911
Thankyou, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

265
00:23:37,045 --> 00:23:39,748
- They will kill you ifyou stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

266
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,918
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

267
00:23:42,048 --> 00:23:43,589
They can't afford to kill her.

268
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:45,836
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

269
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,922
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

270
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,007
My feelings tell me
they will destroyyou.

271
00:23:50,135 --> 00:23:52,505
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.

272
00:23:52,636 --> 00:23:55,090
Senator Palpatine
will need your help.

273
00:23:55,221 --> 00:23:59,168
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.

274
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:01,178
We are brave, Your Highness.

275
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:04,555
Ifyou are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.

276
00:24:04,683 --> 00:24:07,137
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.

277
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:09,975
Be careful, Governor.

278
00:24:18,898 --> 00:24:20,972
We'll need to free those pilots.

279
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:24,105
I'll deal with that.

280
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:28,599
Halt.

281
00:24:28,736 --> 00:24:30,395
I'm ambassador
to the supreme chancellor.

282
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:32,105
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

283
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:35,439
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

284
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:38,192
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.

285
00:24:38,324 --> 00:24:40,232
Uh, wait.
Uh, you're under arrest.

286
00:24:45,703 --> 00:24:46,900
Come on. Move!

287
00:24:52,289 --> 00:24:53,237
Go!

288
00:25:18,802 --> 00:25:22,085
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.

289
00:25:25,888 --> 00:25:28,045
Hello, boyos.

290
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:36,015
There's the blockade.

291
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,063
The shield generator's been hit!

292
00:25:56,569 --> 00:25:58,145
How wude!

293
00:26:08,158 --> 00:26:09,734
We're losing droids fast.

294
00:26:10,576 --> 00:26:13,195
Ifwe can't get the shield generator
fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.

295
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,614
The shields are gone.

296
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,076
The power's back!

297
00:26:28,876 --> 00:26:32,325
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

298
00:26:32,461 --> 00:26:35,033
Deflector shields up at maximum.

299
00:26:44,634 --> 00:26:48,332
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

300
00:26:48,469 --> 00:26:51,338
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

301
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,627
Here, Master.
Tatooine.

302
00:26:53,763 --> 00:26:55,422
It's small, out of the way, poor.

303
00:26:55,556 --> 00:26:57,298
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.

304
00:26:57,431 --> 00:26:59,303
How can you be sure?

305
00:26:59,432 --> 00:27:01,340
It's controlled by the Hutts.

306
00:27:01,475 --> 00:27:04,260
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

307
00:27:04,393 --> 00:27:06,680
- If they discovered her--
- It'd be no different than landing...

308
00:27:06,811 --> 00:27:08,683
on a system controlled
by the Federation...

309
00:27:08,812 --> 00:27:10,886
except that the Hutts
aren't looking for her...

310
00:27:11,021 --> 00:27:13,095
which gives us the advantage.

311
00:27:17,566 --> 00:27:20,565
AndQueenAmidala,
hasshesignedthe treaty?

312
00:27:20,692 --> 00:27:24,308
She has disappeared, my lord.

313
00:27:24,444 --> 00:27:28,605
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.

314
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,650
I want that treatysigned.

315
00:27:31,781 --> 00:27:33,819
My lord...

316
00:27:33,949 --> 00:27:36,485
it's impossible to locate the ship.

317
00:27:36,617 --> 00:27:38,822
It's out of our range.

318
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:41,191
Not fora Sith.

319
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:43,658
This is my apprentice...

320
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,695
Darth Maul.

321
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:50,321
He will findyourlostship.

322
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:56,954
This is getting out of hand.

323
00:27:57,085 --> 00:27:59,123
Now there are two of them.

324
00:27:59,252 --> 00:28:02,251
We should not
have made this bargain.

325
00:28:07,548 --> 00:28:11,080
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

326
00:28:11,216 --> 00:28:14,085
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

327
00:28:14,218 --> 00:28:17,549
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

328
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,341
R2-D2, Your Highness.

329
00:28:22,472 --> 00:28:23,882
Thankyou, R2-D2.

330
00:28:27,682 --> 00:28:29,092
Padmé.

331
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,763
Clean this droid up
as best you can.

332
00:28:32,893 --> 00:28:34,849
It deserves our gratitude.

333
00:28:36,645 --> 00:28:38,186
Continue, Captain.

334
00:28:41,147 --> 00:28:42,972
Your Highness,
with your permission...

335
00:28:43,106 --> 00:28:45,856
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

336
00:28:45,983 --> 00:28:49,314
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

337
00:28:49,443 --> 00:28:52,015
I do not agree
with the  Jedi on this.

338
00:28:52,152 --> 00:28:55,067
You must trust myjudgment,
Your Highness.

339
00:28:58,489 --> 00:29:00,196
Hello.

340
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:03,275
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

341
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,860
I'm Padmé.

MesaJarJar Binks.

343
00:29:09,827 --> 00:29:11,106
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

344
00:29:13,412 --> 00:29:16,992
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

345
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:20,785

00:29:28,503 --> 00:29:30,992
Mesa getten
berry, berry scared.

349
00:29:37,298 --> 00:29:40,380
- That's it-- Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

350
00:29:40,508 --> 00:29:44,585
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

351
00:30:01,852 --> 00:30:04,637
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

352
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,224
That'll complicate things.
Be wary.

353
00:30:07,354 --> 00:30:10,472
- I sense a disturbance in the  force.
- I feel it also, Master.

354
00:30:10,606 --> 00:30:12,644
Don't let them send
any transmissions.

355
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:21,141
The sun doen murder to mesa skin.

356
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,771
Wait!

357
00:30:23,862 --> 00:30:25,272
Wait.

358
00:30:28,698 --> 00:30:31,567
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

359
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:35,445
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

360
00:30:35,576 --> 00:30:37,650
The spaceport
is not going to be pleasant.

361
00:30:37,785 --> 00:30:39,906
The queen wishes it.

362
00:30:40,036 --> 00:30:41,944
She's curious about the planet.

363
00:30:44,538 --> 00:30:47,572
This is not a good idea.
Stay close to me.

364
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,213
Moisture farms,
for the most part.

365
00:31:05,507 --> 00:31:09,205
Some indigenous tribes
and scavengers.

366
00:31:09,342 --> 00:31:11,214
The few spaceports like this one...

367
00:31:11,343 --> 00:31:13,630
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

368
00:31:13,761 --> 00:31:15,669
Like us.

369
00:31:17,012 --> 00:31:19,797
Dissen berry, berry bad.

370
00:31:21,181 --> 00:31:22,888
Icky, icky goo!

371
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:38,302
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

372
00:31:44,025 --> 00:31:45,897
Good day to you.

373
00:31:47,568 --> 00:31:48,942
What do you want?

374
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:52,151
I need parts for aJ-type 327 Nubian.

375
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:56,321
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

376
00:31:57,073 --> 00:31:58,945
Boy, get in here now!

377
00:31:59,074 --> 00:32:00,946
My droid has a readout ofwhat I need.

378
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:05,235
What tookyou so long?

379
00:32:06,077 --> 00:32:07,451
I was cleaning the fan switches.

380
00:32:07,578 --> 00:32:10,328
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

381
00:32:10,454 --> 00:32:13,702
So, let me take thee out back, huh?

382
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:15,703
We'll find what you need.

383
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,915
Don't touch anything.

384
00:32:30,255 --> 00:32:33,124
- Are you an angel?
- What?

385
00:32:33,256 --> 00:32:36,954
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.

386
00:32:37,091 --> 00:32:39,960
They're the most beautiful
creatures in the universe.

387
00:32:40,093 --> 00:32:42,665
They live on the moons of lego,
I think.

388
00:32:43,469 --> 00:32:47,132
You're a funny little boy.
How do you know so much?

389
00:32:47,263 --> 00:32:51,092
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

390
00:32:51,223 --> 00:32:55,514
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

391
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:59,589
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

392
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:02,014
How long have you been here?

393
00:33:02,145 --> 00:33:06,140
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.

394
00:33:06,272 --> 00:33:08,975
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt...

395
00:33:09,107 --> 00:33:11,810
but she lost us
betting on the Podraces.

396
00:33:11,941 --> 00:33:13,731
You're a slave?

397
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:17,984
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

398
00:33:18,111 --> 00:33:21,857
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

399
00:33:34,285 --> 00:33:35,826
- I got ya.
- Hey!

400
00:33:35,953 --> 00:33:37,695
Hit the nose.

401
00:33:42,372 --> 00:33:45,904
A T-1 4 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

402
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:48,660
I'm the only one hereabouts
who has one.

403
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:52,289
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.

404
00:33:53,961 --> 00:33:55,335
Saying ofwhich...

405
00:33:55,462 --> 00:33:57,832
how's thee gonna pay
for all this, huh?

406
00:33:57,963 --> 00:34:00,001
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

407
00:34:00,131 --> 00:34:01,956
Republic credits?

408
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:05,005
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

409
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:08,251
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

410
00:34:08,384 --> 00:34:12,000
- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.

411
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:13,961
No, they won't!

412
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:18,257
What, you thinkyou're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

413
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:22,633
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

414
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:26,842
No money, no parts, no deal.

415
00:34:26,977 --> 00:34:31,517
And no one else has a T-1 4 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

416
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,643
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

417
00:34:46,402 --> 00:34:48,274
We're leaving.JarJar.

418
00:34:50,905 --> 00:34:53,441
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

419
00:34:53,572 --> 00:34:55,397
I was glad to meet you too.

420
00:35:03,786 --> 00:35:08,326
Outlanders.
They think we know nothing.

421
00:35:08,454 --> 00:35:10,362
They seemed nice to me.

422
00:35:10,497 --> 00:35:12,405
Clean the racks.

423
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,867
Then you can go home.

424
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:15,789
Yippee!

425
00:35:21,836 --> 00:35:24,206
Andyou'resure there's
nothingleft on board?

426
00:35:24,337 --> 00:35:26,209
A few containers of supplies.

427
00:35:26,338 --> 00:35:29,372
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough foryou to barter with...

428
00:35:29,506 --> 00:35:31,830
not in the amount
you're talking about.

429
00:35:31,966 --> 00:35:34,881
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

430
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:36,383
I'll check back later.

431
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,835
Noah gain. Noah gain.

432
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:41,802
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

433
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:44,383
Wesa be wobbed un crunched.

434
00:35:44,513 --> 00:35:47,678
Not likely. We have nothing ofvalue.
That's our problem.

435
00:36:02,938 --> 00:36:04,348
Are you going to pay for that?

436
00:36:06,357 --> 00:36:08,229
It costs seven wupiupi.

437
00:36:13,527 --> 00:36:14,854
Oops.

438
00:36:19,363 --> 00:36:21,235
Is this yours?

439
00:36:21,364 --> 00:36:23,106
Who, mesa--

440
00:36:27,283 --> 00:36:29,404
Careful, Sebulba.

441
00:36:29,534 --> 00:36:31,525
He's a big-time outlander.

442
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,192
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

443
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:39,194
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end ofyou.

444
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:42,365
Ifyou weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

445
00:36:43,082 --> 00:36:45,915
Yeah, it'd be a pity
ifyou had to pay for me.

446
00:36:47,043 --> 00:36:50,161
- Hi.
- Hi there.

447
00:36:50,294 --> 00:36:52,084
Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.

448
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:54,084
He picked a fight with a Dug...

449
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:56,702
an especially dangerous Dug
called Sebulba.

450
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:00,419
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

451
00:37:00,549 --> 00:37:04,544
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

452
00:37:05,093 --> 00:37:06,550
Thanks, myyoung friend.

453
00:37:08,845 --> 00:37:10,717
But mesa doen nutten!

454
00:37:19,224 --> 00:37:21,796
This storm will slow them down.

455
00:37:21,934 --> 00:37:23,427
Looks pretty bad.

456
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:27,258
- Panaka.
- Receivinga message from home.

457
00:37:27,395 --> 00:37:29,185
We'll be right there.

458
00:37:35,607 --> 00:37:37,764
Here, you'll like these pallies.

459
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,472
- Here.
- Thankyou.

460
00:37:41,652 --> 00:37:43,939
My bones are aching.

461
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:48,609
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

462
00:37:48,738 --> 00:37:51,571
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

463
00:37:51,698 --> 00:37:54,270
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

464
00:37:54,408 --> 00:37:56,778
You'll never reach
the outskirts in time.

465
00:37:56,909 --> 00:38:00,774
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

466
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:03,365
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.

467
00:38:18,085 --> 00:38:19,282
Mom!

468
00:38:19,419 --> 00:38:23,117
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ah, dissen cosy.

469
00:38:23,255 --> 00:38:25,625
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

470
00:38:25,756 --> 00:38:29,288
- I'm Qui-GonJinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

471
00:38:29,424 --> 00:38:31,794
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

472
00:38:31,925 --> 00:38:33,881
Come on. I'll showyou 3PO.

473
00:38:43,681 --> 00:38:46,929
Isn't he great?
He's not finished yet.

474
00:38:47,057 --> 00:38:48,336
He's wonderful.

475
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,307
You really like him?

476
00:38:51,434 --> 00:38:54,349
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.

477
00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:00,050
Where is everybody?

478
00:39:00,189 --> 00:39:01,351
Whoops.

479
00:39:04,566 --> 00:39:05,728
Oh, hello.

480
00:39:05,858 --> 00:39:09,141
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

481
00:39:09,276 --> 00:39:11,148
How might I serve you?

482
00:39:11,277 --> 00:39:14,062
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

483
00:39:14,195 --> 00:39:17,727
When the storm is over, I'll showyou
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.

484
00:39:19,114 --> 00:39:21,650
I'm not sure this floor
is entirely stable.

485
00:39:21,782 --> 00:39:24,983
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.

486
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:29,150
R2-D2.
A pleasure to meet you.

487
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:32,320
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

488
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:38,156
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?

489
00:39:39,832 --> 00:39:43,080
My parts are showing?
My goodness!

490
00:39:47,711 --> 00:39:50,165
The death toll is catastrophic.

491
00:39:50,296 --> 00:39:52,666
We mustbow to their wishes.

492
00:39:52,797 --> 00:39:54,835
You must contactme.

493
00:39:54,964 --> 00:39:57,631
It's a trick.
Send no reply.

494
00:39:57,757 --> 00:39:59,748
Send no transmissions of any kind.

495
00:40:02,051 --> 00:40:04,920
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

496
00:40:05,053 --> 00:40:09,000
What if it is true,
and the people are dying?

497
00:40:09,138 --> 00:40:11,592
Either way,
we're running out of time.

498
00:40:25,229 --> 00:40:27,350
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

499
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,265
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

500
00:40:30,398 --> 00:40:32,270
Move against the Jedi first.

501
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:35,102
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

502
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:37,105
to sign the treaty.

503
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:39,391
At last we will reveal ourselves
to the Jedi.

504
00:40:39,527 --> 00:40:41,933
At last we will have revenge.

505
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,939
You have been well-trained,
myyoung apprentice.

506
00:40:45,071 --> 00:40:47,441
They will be no match foryou.

507
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:56,320
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

508
00:40:57,411 --> 00:41:00,410
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

509
00:41:00,537 --> 00:41:04,034
- Any attempt to escape--
- And they blowyou up!

510
00:41:04,956 --> 00:41:06,532
How wude!

511
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:09,071
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

512
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:11,080
The Republic's antislavery laws--

513
00:41:11,209 --> 00:41:13,533
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

514
00:41:13,668 --> 00:41:15,825
We must survive on our own.

515
00:41:16,836 --> 00:41:18,329
Xcuse me.

516
00:41:20,421 --> 00:41:22,957
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

517
00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:24,879
They have Podracing
on Malastare.

518
00:41:25,007 --> 00:41:27,710
Very fast, very dangerous.

519
00:41:28,508 --> 00:41:30,380
I'm the only human who can do it.

520
00:41:30,509 --> 00:41:33,508
You must have Jedi reflexes
ifyou race pods.

521
00:41:34,636 --> 00:41:36,010
Don't do that again.

522
00:41:41,473 --> 00:41:44,045
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

523
00:41:47,017 --> 00:41:49,886
- What makes you think that?
- I sawyour laser sword.

524
00:41:50,019 --> 00:41:52,888
Only Jedis carry
that kind ofweapon.

525
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:56,138
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

526
00:41:56,272 --> 00:41:57,895
I don't think so.

527
00:41:58,022 --> 00:42:00,179
No one can kill a Jedi.

528
00:42:01,024 --> 00:42:03,062
I wish that were so.

529
00:42:03,191 --> 00:42:05,229
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

530
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,524
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.

531
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:11,983
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

532
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:16,439
I thinkyou have.
Why else would you be here?

533
00:42:21,325 --> 00:42:24,075
I can see there's
no fooling you, Anakin.

534
00:42:24,201 --> 00:42:27,200
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic...

535
00:42:27,328 --> 00:42:29,319
on a very important mission.

536
00:42:29,454 --> 00:42:32,488
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?

537
00:42:32,622 --> 00:42:36,238
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.

538
00:42:37,499 --> 00:42:40,700
I can help.
I can fix anything.

539
00:42:40,834 --> 00:42:42,327
I believe you can.

540
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,245
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

541
00:42:45,378 --> 00:42:48,081
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

542
00:42:48,213 --> 00:42:51,745
Thesejunk dealers
must have a weakness of some kind.

543
00:42:51,881 --> 00:42:56,172
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

544
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,544
Podracing.

545
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:00,590
Greed can be a powerful ally.

546
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:03,588
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.

547
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,007
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

548
00:43:06,138 --> 00:43:08,094
You could enter my pod.

549
00:43:09,056 --> 00:43:12,090
- Anakin, Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

550
00:43:12,224 --> 00:43:14,096
You could make him think
it was yours...

551
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:16,430
and get him
to let me pilot it foryou.

552
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:18,135
I don't want you to race.
It's awful.

553
00:43:18,269 --> 00:43:20,758
I die every time
Watto makes you do it.

554
00:43:20,895 --> 00:43:23,016
But, Mom, I love it.

555
00:43:23,146 --> 00:43:26,678
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

556
00:43:26,814 --> 00:43:29,101
Anakin.

557
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,982
Your mother's right.

558
00:43:32,108 --> 00:43:35,190
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

559
00:43:36,694 --> 00:43:38,353
No.

560
00:43:43,447 --> 00:43:48,071
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

561
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:55,779
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

562
00:43:55,911 --> 00:43:57,819
We'll find some other way.

563
00:44:00,288 --> 00:44:02,742
There is no other way.

564
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:07,200
I may not like it,
but he can help you.

565
00:44:08,084 --> 00:44:09,956
He was meant to help you.

566
00:44:23,508 --> 00:44:25,380
Are you sure about this?

567
00:44:25,509 --> 00:44:28,128
Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?

568
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,298
The queen will not approve.

569
00:44:30,428 --> 00:44:32,300
The queen doesn't need to know.

570
00:44:33,429 --> 00:44:35,052
Well, I don't approve.

571
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,799
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

572
00:44:38,932 --> 00:44:40,555
How can you do this?

573
00:44:40,682 --> 00:44:43,965
Not on the Republic credits,
I think.

574
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:46,258
My ship will be the entry fee.

575
00:44:46,769 --> 00:44:48,476
Not bad!

576
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:51,555
Not bad, huh?
Nubian, huh?

577
00:44:51,688 --> 00:44:54,971
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

578
00:44:55,106 --> 00:44:57,595
What would the boy ride?

579
00:44:57,732 --> 00:45:01,264
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It would take some long time to fix it.

580
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,724
It wasn't my fault.
Really.

581
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,483
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

582
00:45:05,611 --> 00:45:08,978
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

583
00:45:10,113 --> 00:45:12,567
That you did.

584
00:45:12,697 --> 00:45:15,482
The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?

585
00:45:15,615 --> 00:45:18,104
I have acquired a pod
in a game of chance.

586
00:45:18,242 --> 00:45:19,901
The fastest ever built.

587
00:45:20,034 --> 00:45:25,156
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

588
00:45:27,121 --> 00:45:30,653
So, you supply the pod
and the entry fee...

589
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:32,163
and I supply the boy.

590
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:36,155
We split the winnings 50-50,
I think, huh?

591
00:45:36,292 --> 00:45:38,164
If it's going to be 50-50...

592
00:45:38,293 --> 00:45:40,912
I suggest you front the cash
for the entry.

593
00:45:41,044 --> 00:45:43,082
Ifwe win...

594
00:45:43,212 --> 00:45:46,993
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

595
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:50,331
And ifwe lose,
you keep my ship.

596
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,210
Either way, you win.

597
00:46:00,011 --> 00:46:01,338
Deal!

598
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:10,800
Your friend
is a foolish one, methinks.

599
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:21,685
What if this plan fails, Master?

600
00:46:21,813 --> 00:46:24,516
We could be stuck here
a very long time.

601
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:27,184
Well, it's too dangerous
to call forhelp...

602
00:46:27,316 --> 00:46:30,683
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

603
00:46:30,818 --> 00:46:32,774
And...

604
00:46:32,902 --> 00:46:34,774
there's something about this boy.

605
00:46:41,614 --> 00:46:43,938
You should be very proud ofyour son.

606
00:46:44,699 --> 00:46:47,023
He gives without any thought
of reward.

607
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:50,028
He knows nothing of greed.

608
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,238
He has--

609
00:46:52,244 --> 00:46:54,116
He has special powers.

610
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:57,110
Yes.

611
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:59,866
He can see things
before they happen.

612
00:46:59,998 --> 00:47:02,783
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

613
00:47:02,916 --> 00:47:04,788
It's a Jedi trait.

614
00:47:04,917 --> 00:47:07,702
He deserves better
than a slave's life.

615
00:47:07,835 --> 00:47:11,202
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

616
00:47:13,629 --> 00:47:17,375
The  force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

617
00:47:17,506 --> 00:47:19,248
Who was his father?

618
00:47:21,967 --> 00:47:23,875
There was no father.

619
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:28,674
I carried him,
I gave birth, I raised him.

620
00:47:29,554 --> 00:47:32,043
I can't explain what happened.

621
00:47:33,722 --> 00:47:35,512
Can you help him?

622
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,512
I don't know.

623
00:47:40,017 --> 00:47:43,633
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.

624
00:47:56,775 --> 00:47:58,647
Wow, a real astro droid!

625
00:48:00,568 --> 00:48:04,314
- How do you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

626
00:48:04,445 --> 00:48:07,397
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

627
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:09,237
With this?

628
00:48:09,364 --> 00:48:12,114
You're such a joker, Ani.

629
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,441
- You've been working on that foryears.
- It's never gonna run.

630
00:48:15,575 --> 00:48:17,732
Come on.
Let's go and play ball.

631
00:48:17,868 --> 00:48:21,151
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

632
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:32,077
Keep away from
those energy binders.

633
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:35,657
Ifyour hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

634
00:48:35,793 --> 00:48:37,167
Okay.

635
00:48:40,879 --> 00:48:43,415
My tongue is fat.

636
00:48:43,547 --> 00:48:46,629
My tongue-- Wrench.

637
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,424
Where is de wrench?
Oh, dare it is.

638
00:48:53,885 --> 00:48:55,426
I'm stuck.

639
00:48:55,552 --> 00:48:59,547
You know, I find thatJarJar creature
to be a little odd.

640
00:49:01,389 --> 00:49:04,222
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.

641
00:49:04,348 --> 00:49:06,422
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

642
00:49:06,558 --> 00:49:08,763
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

643
00:49:08,892 --> 00:49:10,930
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.

644
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,265
My mouth.

645
00:49:13,394 --> 00:49:14,721
Ani, I'm stuck.

646
00:49:19,939 --> 00:49:22,096
My tongue is fat.

647
00:49:22,232 --> 00:49:25,184
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.

648
00:49:27,401 --> 00:49:29,439
Thankyou.

649
00:49:29,568 --> 00:49:30,978
Go.

650
00:49:45,493 --> 00:49:49,109
It's working!
It's working!

651
00:49:59,749 --> 00:50:02,238
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.

652
00:50:02,376 --> 00:50:06,288
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

653
00:50:06,419 --> 00:50:08,291
Most of them.

654
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,376
Has anyone been to 'em all?

655
00:50:12,088 --> 00:50:13,285
Not likely.

656
00:50:14,423 --> 00:50:16,628
I wanna be the first one
to see 'em all.

657
00:50:17,841 --> 00:50:20,211
Ani, bedtime!

658
00:50:20,342 --> 00:50:23,092
There we are.
Good as new.

659
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:26,088
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

660
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,634
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

661
00:50:29,763 --> 00:50:31,304
Go on.

662
00:50:31,431 --> 00:50:33,387
You have a big day tomorrow.

663
00:50:33,515 --> 00:50:35,387
Sleep well, Ani.

664
00:50:38,142 --> 00:50:40,133
- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?

665
00:50:40,268 --> 00:50:42,971
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

666
00:50:43,103 --> 00:50:44,810
Wait a minute.

667
00:50:46,521 --> 00:50:48,477
I need a midi-chlorian count.

668
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,059
The reading is off the chart.

669
00:50:54,192 --> 00:50:56,064
Over 20,000.

670
00:50:56,193 --> 00:50:59,809
Even Master Yoda doesn'thave
a midi-chlorian count thathigh.

671
00:50:59,944 --> 00:51:01,734
No Jedi has.

672
00:51:01,862 --> 00:51:03,900
What does that mean?

673
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,403
I'm not sure.

674
00:52:16,314 --> 00:52:19,183
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

675
00:52:19,315 --> 00:52:21,057
Patience, my blue friend.

676
00:52:21,191 --> 00:52:23,431
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.

677
00:52:23,567 --> 00:52:25,357
And we'll be far away from here.

678
00:52:25,485 --> 00:52:29,527
Not ifyour ship belongs to me,
I think, huh?

679
00:52:29,653 --> 00:52:33,020
I warn you, no funny business.

680
00:52:33,155 --> 00:52:36,273
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrongo.

681
00:52:36,406 --> 00:52:38,860
I have great faith in the boy.

682
00:52:38,991 --> 00:52:41,112
He's a credit to your race...

683
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:44,443
but Sebulba there
is going to win, I think.

684
00:52:46,578 --> 00:52:48,320
Oh, no!

685
00:52:52,497 --> 00:52:54,322
Why do you think that?

686
00:52:54,457 --> 00:52:56,329
He always wins!

687
00:52:58,333 --> 00:53:00,787
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

688
00:53:02,627 --> 00:53:05,330
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

689
00:53:06,087 --> 00:53:09,418
I'll wager my new racing pod
against, say...

690
00:53:09,547 --> 00:53:11,419
the boy and his mother.

691
00:53:11,548 --> 00:53:15,246
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

692
00:53:16,175 --> 00:53:17,917
The boy, then.

693
00:53:24,137 --> 00:53:26,626
We'll let fate decide, huh?

694
00:53:26,764 --> 00:53:30,178
I just happen to have
a chance cube here.

695
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:33,341
Blue, it's the boy.

696
00:53:33,475 --> 00:53:34,589
Red...

697
00:53:36,018 --> 00:53:37,641
his mother.

698
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:49,763
You won this small toss,
outlander...

699
00:53:49,899 --> 00:53:52,020
but you won't win the race!

700
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:54,224
So it makes little difference!

701
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:08,939
Better stop your friend's betting
or I'll end up owning him too.

702
00:54:12,702 --> 00:54:15,191
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

703
00:54:15,328 --> 00:54:16,702
Good morning.

704
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:21,580
Oh, my.
Space travel sounds rather perilous.

705
00:54:23,665 --> 00:54:27,660
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

706
00:54:27,792 --> 00:54:31,159
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

707
00:54:31,294 --> 00:54:32,372
Do what?

708
00:54:32,503 --> 00:54:35,537
Finish the race, of course.

709
00:54:35,671 --> 00:54:37,413
You've never won a race?

710
00:54:37,547 --> 00:54:40,250
Well, not exactly.

711
00:54:40,382 --> 00:54:42,373
Not even finished?

712
00:54:42,508 --> 00:54:44,962
Kitster's right.
I will this time.

713
00:54:45,092 --> 00:54:47,130
Of course you will.

714
00:55:16,774 --> 00:55:18,599
That's absolutely right.

715
00:55:18,733 --> 00:55:23,771
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

716
00:55:23,902 --> 00:55:27,518
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.

717
00:55:29,613 --> 00:55:32,446
Isee Ben Quadinaros
from the TundSystem.

718
00:55:38,117 --> 00:55:40,571
Two-time winnerBoles Roor.

719
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:44,909
Sebulba.!

720
00:55:55,334 --> 00:55:58,416
And in the front row,
nearside pole position...

721
00:55:58,543 --> 00:56:00,534
Mawhonic.!

722
00:56:01,753 --> 00:56:03,791
A heartyhello...

723
00:56:03,921 --> 00:56:07,619
to Clegg Holdfast
andhis Voltec KT9 Wasp.!

724
00:56:10,632 --> 00:56:13,631
Andbackagain,
it's the mightyDudBolt...

725
00:56:13,759 --> 00:56:18,335

the Vulptereen 327.

726
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:23,966
Andhoping fora big win today...

727
00:56:24,097 --> 00:56:28,507
Ody Mandrell,
with his record-settingpit droidteam.

728
00:56:33,393 --> 00:56:36,641
Anda late entry,
youngAnakin Skywalker...

729
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:38,049
a localboy.

730
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:43,012
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

731
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,781
Be safe.

732
00:57:04,908 --> 00:57:07,232
I will, Mom. I promise.

733
00:57:23,417 --> 00:57:26,084
You won't walk away from this one...

734
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,450
you slave scum.

735
00:57:28,586 --> 00:57:31,834
Don't count on it, slime ball.

736
00:57:31,962 --> 00:57:34,332
You're bantha fodder!

737
00:57:38,924 --> 00:57:41,129
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

738
00:57:41,258 --> 00:57:42,881
Right.

739
00:57:47,011 --> 00:57:49,630
Remember, concentrate
on the moment.

740
00:57:49,762 --> 00:57:53,508
Feel, don't think.
Use your instincts.

741
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:55,262
I will.

742
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:57,595
May the  force be with you.

743
00:58:06,562 --> 00:58:08,553
Jabba the Hutt.

744
00:58:18,776 --> 00:58:23,186
Welcome.

745
00:58:24,154 --> 00:58:27,402
Begin the race!

746
00:58:37,952 --> 00:58:41,117
Hey, looks like
they're clearing thegrid.

747
00:58:42,329 --> 00:58:44,201
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

748
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:48,699
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not--

749
00:58:48,832 --> 00:58:51,701
The queen trusts myjudgment,
young handmaiden.

750
00:58:51,833 --> 00:58:54,038
You should too.

751
00:58:54,168 --> 00:58:56,242
You assume too much.

752
00:58:57,002 --> 00:58:59,408
Startyourengines.

753
00:59:38,689 --> 00:59:42,020
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

754
01:00:02,033 --> 01:00:03,312
Oh, no!

755
01:00:08,953 --> 01:00:12,236
Wait.
Little Skywalker has stalled.

756
01:00:22,709 --> 01:00:26,918
Itlooks like Quadinaros
ishaving engine trouble also.

757
01:00:28,504 --> 01:00:29,783
Come on, Ani!

758
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:37,792
Andtheregoes Skywalker.!

759
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:39,382
Go, Ani, go!

760
01:00:39,509 --> 01:00:41,630
He willbe hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.

761
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:58,627
Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are campedout...

762
01:01:58,755 --> 01:02:01,042
on the canyon dune turn.

763
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:15,959
There goes Quadinaros'
power coupling.

764
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:45,898
Oh, no!

765
01:02:50,696 --> 01:02:52,568
Where is Master Anakin?

766
01:02:55,823 --> 01:02:58,028
Look. Here he comes.

767
01:03:00,909 --> 01:03:03,233
Itlooks like Skywalker
ismoving up in the field.

768
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:05,529
Yay! Yippee!

769
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:16,620
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.

770
01:04:24,198 --> 01:04:26,070
Skywalker's
spinning out of control!

771
01:05:23,976 --> 01:05:27,923
I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

772
01:05:34,982 --> 01:05:36,689
Here he comes!

773
01:05:36,816 --> 01:05:39,934
At thestart ofthe thirdandfinallap,
Sebulba's in the lead...

774
01:05:40,067 --> 01:05:42,556
followedclosely by Skywalker.!

775
01:05:42,694 --> 01:05:43,558
Go, Ani!

776
01:06:10,582 --> 01:06:12,906
Skywalker's been  forced
onto the service ramp!

777
01:06:34,593 --> 01:06:35,967
It's Skywalker!

778
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,254
Sebulba!

779
01:06:38,386 --> 01:06:42,630
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

780
01:06:42,764 --> 01:07:16,447
Did he crash-ed?

781
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,185
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

782
01:08:21,923 --> 01:08:23,574
He's catching Sebulba!

783
01:08:24,702 --> 01:08:27,179
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

784
01:08:57,392 --> 01:08:59,751
That little human being
is out of his mind!

785
01:09:00,877 --> 01:09:02,034
They're side byside.!

786
01:09:30,539 --> 01:09:32,402
- Yippee!
- Yay!

787
01:09:36,596 --> 01:09:38,294
I can't believe it.

788
01:09:38,421 --> 01:09:40,319
The crowds are going nuts!

789
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:51,236
Yay, Ani!

790
01:09:52,568 --> 01:09:55,588
Mom, I did it! Yay!

791
01:10:06,052 --> 01:10:07,915
Good going, Ani!

792
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:14,220
We owe you everything, Ani.

793
01:10:16,837 --> 01:10:18,948
It's so wonderful, Ani.

794
01:10:19,077 --> 01:10:21,768
You have brought hope
to those who have none.

795
01:10:21,899 --> 01:10:24,093
I'm so very proud ofyou.

796
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:36,373
You!

797
01:10:36,502 --> 01:10:38,778
You swindled me.

798
01:10:38,908 --> 01:10:42,672
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehowyou knew it.

799
01:10:42,808 --> 01:10:44,671
I lost everything.

800
01:10:44,799 --> 01:10:48,314
Wheneveryou gamble, my friend,
eventuallyyou lose.

801
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:50,892
Bring the parts
to the main hangar.

802
01:10:51,022 --> 01:10:54,089
I'll come byyour shop later on
so you can release the boy.

803
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:57,483
You can't have him.
It wasn't a fair bet.

804
01:11:00,231 --> 01:11:03,664
Would you like to discuss it
with the Hutts?

805
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,277
I'm sure they can settle this.

806
01:11:07,782 --> 01:11:09,645
Take him.

807
01:11:16,577 --> 01:11:17,602
Hidoe!

808
01:11:19,232 --> 01:11:21,296
Well, we have all
the essential parts we need.

809
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:22,456
I'm going back.

810
01:11:22,593 --> 01:11:24,657
Some unfinished business.
I won't be long.

811
01:11:24,792 --> 01:11:28,224
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?

812
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:32,125
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.

813
01:11:32,259 --> 01:11:34,122
Get this hyperdrive
generator installed.

814
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:36,774
Yes, Master.
That shouldn't take long.

815
01:11:36,905 --> 01:11:39,051
Come on. Hup!

816
01:11:43,668 --> 01:11:45,531
Hey. These are yours.

817
01:11:47,526 --> 01:11:48,764
Yes!

818
01:11:50,441 --> 01:11:53,177
Mom, we sold the pod!
Look at all the money we have!

819
01:11:53,303 --> 01:11:55,662
My goodness!
But that's so wonderful, Ani.

820
01:11:55,792 --> 01:11:58,730
- And he has been freed.
- What?

821
01:11:58,862 --> 01:12:00,643
You're no longer a slave.

822
01:12:02,555 --> 01:12:04,453
Did you hear that?

823
01:12:05,252 --> 01:12:07,694
Nowyou can make
your dreams come true, Ani.

824
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:10,468
You are free.

825
01:12:14,046 --> 01:12:15,496
Will you take him with you?

826
01:12:15,622 --> 01:12:17,237
Is he to become a Jedi?

827
01:12:17,365 --> 01:12:19,889
Yes. Our meeting
was not a coincidence.

828
01:12:20,725 --> 01:12:22,377
Nothing happens by accident.

829
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:26,025
You mean I get to come with you
in your starship?

830
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:27,563
Anakin...

831
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:32,746
training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge...

832
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:35,736
and even ifyou succeed,
it's a hard life.

833
01:12:35,867 --> 01:12:39,016
But I wanna go. It's what
I've always dreamed of doing.

834
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:41,962
Can I go, Mom?

835
01:12:42,921 --> 01:12:44,572
Anakin...

836
01:12:44,704 --> 01:12:47,605
this path has been placed
before you.

837
01:12:47,733 --> 01:12:50,175
The choice is yours alone.

838
01:12:53,831 --> 01:12:55,694
I wanna do it.

839
01:12:58,270 --> 01:13:00,464
Then packyour things.
We haven't much time.

840
01:13:07,065 --> 01:13:08,634
What about Mom?

841
01:13:11,753 --> 01:13:13,616
Is she free too?

842
01:13:13,744 --> 01:13:17,224
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

843
01:13:18,266 --> 01:13:20,212
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Mom?

844
01:13:28,181 --> 01:13:31,496
Son, my place is here.
My future is here.

845
01:13:31,625 --> 01:13:33,984
It is time foryou to let go.

846
01:13:35,109 --> 01:13:37,220
I don't want things to change.

847
01:13:37,349 --> 01:13:39,708
But you can't stop the change...

848
01:13:39,838 --> 01:13:42,906
any more than you can
stop the suns from setting.

849
01:13:43,988 --> 01:13:45,886
I love you.

850
01:13:51,538 --> 01:13:53,401
Now hurry.

851
01:13:58,922 --> 01:14:00,289
Thankyou.

852
01:14:00,415 --> 01:14:03,317
I'll watch after him.
You have my word.

853
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,046
Will you be all right?

854
01:14:08,506 --> 01:14:09,956
Yeah.

855
01:14:14,977 --> 01:14:16,546
Hello, Master Anakin.

856
01:14:16,678 --> 01:14:18,742
Well, 3PO, I've been freed...

857
01:14:18,876 --> 01:14:21,235
and I'm going away in a starship.

858
01:14:21,365 --> 01:14:24,267
Master Anakin, you are my maker
and I wish you well.

859
01:14:24,395 --> 01:14:28,583
However, I should prefer it
if I were a little more completed.

860
01:14:28,709 --> 01:14:31,811
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to finish you, 3PO...

861
01:14:31,945 --> 01:14:33,973
give you coverings and all.

862
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:35,717
I'm gonna miss working on you.

863
01:14:35,844 --> 01:14:38,286
You've been a great pal.

864
01:14:38,416 --> 01:14:41,023
I'll make sure Mom
doesn't sell you or anything.

865
01:14:41,818 --> 01:14:42,844
Sell me?

866
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:44,595
Bye.

867
01:14:44,723 --> 01:14:46,090
Oh, my.

868
01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:12,804
I can't do it, Mom.
I just can't do it.

869
01:15:17,081 --> 01:15:19,062
Will I ever see you again?

870
01:15:20,524 --> 01:15:23,380
What does your heart tell you?

871
01:15:24,715 --> 01:15:26,613
I hope so.

872
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:29,233
Yes.

873
01:15:29,361 --> 01:15:30,930
I guess.

874
01:15:31,975 --> 01:15:34,534
Then we will
see each other again.

875
01:15:37,243 --> 01:15:40,015
I will come back
and free you, Mom.

876
01:15:40,147 --> 01:15:41,845
I promise.

877
01:15:50,063 --> 01:15:53,001
Now, be brave...

878
01:15:53,796 --> 01:15:55,777
and don't look back.

879
01:15:56,575 --> 01:15:58,438
Don't look back.

880
01:16:42,791 --> 01:16:43,864
Qui-Gon, sir, wait!

881
01:16:43,994 --> 01:16:45,728
- I'm tired!
- Anakin! Drop!

882
01:16:48,184 --> 01:16:49,127
Go!

883
01:16:50,175 --> 01:16:52,073
Tell them to take off!

884
01:17:04,613 --> 01:17:06,063
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

885
01:17:07,351 --> 01:17:08,718
Take off.

886
01:17:09,425 --> 01:17:11,159
Over there. Fly low.

887
01:17:32,657 --> 01:17:35,641
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

888
01:17:35,768 --> 01:17:37,301
What was it?

889
01:17:37,427 --> 01:17:39,161
I'm not sure...

890
01:17:39,294 --> 01:17:41,818
but it was well-trained
in the Jedi arts.

891
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:44,433
My guess is
it was after the queen.

892
01:17:44,563 --> 01:17:47,040
What are we gonna do about it?

893
01:17:49,002 --> 01:17:50,617
We shall be patient.

894
01:17:50,745 --> 01:17:51,853
Anakin Skywalker...

895
01:17:51,989 --> 01:17:53,770
meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

896
01:17:56,179 --> 01:17:58,703
You're a Jedi too?
Pleased to meet you.

897
01:18:07,629 --> 01:18:10,153
Your queen is lost,
your people are starving...

898
01:18:10,284 --> 01:18:12,265
and you, Governor,
are going to die...

899
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,511
much sooner than your people,
I'm afraid.

900
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,117
This invasion
will gain you nothing.

901
01:18:17,254 --> 01:18:20,238
We're a democracy.
The people have decided.

902
01:18:20,365 --> 01:18:22,229
Take him away.

903
01:18:25,676 --> 01:18:28,118
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...

904
01:18:28,248 --> 01:18:30,772
for these rumoured
underwater villages.

905
01:18:30,903 --> 01:18:33,510
They will not
stay hidden for long.

906
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:47,200
The death toll is catastrophic.

907
01:18:47,331 --> 01:18:49,938
We mustbow to their wishes.

908
01:18:50,069 --> 01:18:52,263
You must contactme.

909
01:19:06,332 --> 01:19:08,230
You all right?

910
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:11,175
It's very cold.

911
01:19:19,109 --> 01:19:21,845
You come from
a warm planet, Ani.

912
01:19:21,971 --> 01:19:24,331
A little too warm
for my taste.

913
01:19:24,461 --> 01:19:26,690
Space is cold.

914
01:19:26,826 --> 01:19:28,937
You seem sad.

915
01:19:30,103 --> 01:19:32,332
The queen is worried.

916
01:19:32,468 --> 01:19:34,862
Her people are suffering, dying.

917
01:19:34,998 --> 01:19:38,478
She must convince the senate
to intervene or...

918
01:19:39,935 --> 01:19:42,212
I'm not sure what'll happen.

919
01:19:43,669 --> 01:19:45,697
I made this foryou...

920
01:19:47,195 --> 01:19:49,058
so you'd remember me.

921
01:19:49,767 --> 01:19:52,421
I carved it
out of a japor snippet.

922
01:19:52,547 --> 01:19:55,366
It'll bring you good fortune.

923
01:19:55,492 --> 01:19:57,355
It's beautiful.

924
01:19:57,483 --> 01:19:59,842
But I don't need this
to rememberyou by.

925
01:20:03,499 --> 01:20:06,849
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani...

926
01:20:06,984 --> 01:20:09,508
but my caring foryou will remain.

927
01:20:12,211 --> 01:20:15,313
I care foryou, too, only l--

928
01:20:15,447 --> 01:20:17,593
Miss your mother.

929
01:20:35,982 --> 01:20:40,123
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

930
01:20:40,255 --> 01:20:41,989
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

931
01:20:42,122 --> 01:20:45,355
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

932
01:21:14,688 --> 01:21:17,708
It is a great gift
to see you alive, Your Majesty.

933
01:21:17,841 --> 01:21:20,779
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.

934
01:21:20,911 --> 01:21:23,354
I'm anxious to hearyour report
on the situation.

935
01:21:23,484 --> 01:21:26,091
May I present
Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

936
01:21:26,222 --> 01:21:28,168
Welcome, Your Highness.

937
01:21:28,296 --> 01:21:30,324
It's an honour to finally
meet you in person.

938
01:21:30,453 --> 01:21:31,903
Thankyou, Supreme Chancellor.

939
01:21:32,029 --> 01:21:35,509
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

940
01:21:35,639 --> 01:21:39,036
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hearyour position.

941
01:21:40,202 --> 01:21:43,270
I'm grateful foryour concern,
Chancellor.

942
01:21:43,397 --> 01:21:45,260
There is a question
of procedure...

943
01:21:45,388 --> 01:21:47,865
but I'm confident
we can overcome it.

944
01:21:48,707 --> 01:21:50,853
I must speak with the Jedi Council
immediately.

945
01:21:50,988 --> 01:21:53,760
The situation has become
much more complicated.

946
01:21:59,493 --> 01:22:01,391
Ani, come on.

947
01:22:12,561 --> 01:22:15,251
Da queen's a bein grossly nice,
mesa tinks.

948
01:22:16,585 --> 01:22:18,531
Pitty hot.

949
01:22:46,289 --> 01:22:49,391
There is no civility,
only politics.

950
01:22:50,687 --> 01:22:54,533
The Republic
is not what it once was.

951
01:22:54,669 --> 01:22:59,883
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

952
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:04,082
There is no interest
in the common good.

953
01:23:04,958 --> 01:23:06,573
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

954
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:09,390
There is little chance the senate
will act on the invasion.

955
01:23:09,521 --> 01:23:12,211
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

956
01:23:12,342 --> 01:23:14,205
If I may say so, Your Majesty...

957
01:23:14,333 --> 01:23:16,527
the chancellor
has little real power.

958
01:23:16,656 --> 01:23:20,502
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.

959
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:24,368
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?

960
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,975
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

961
01:23:28,107 --> 01:23:30,301
of a stronger
supreme chancellor...

962
01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:32,576
one who could control
the bureaucrats...

963
01:23:32,711 --> 01:23:34,527
and give usjustice.

964
01:23:35,408 --> 01:23:40,882
You could call for a vote of
no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.

965
01:23:41,008 --> 01:23:43,486
He has been
our strongest supporter.

966
01:23:43,623 --> 01:23:48,802
Our only other choice would be
to submit a plea to the courts.

967
01:23:48,933 --> 01:23:52,248
The courts take even longer
to decide things than the senate.

968
01:23:53,164 --> 01:23:55,228
Our people are dying, Senator.

969
01:23:56,026 --> 01:23:59,010
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

970
01:23:59,138 --> 01:24:01,615
To be realistic, Your Majesty...

971
01:24:01,751 --> 01:24:04,229
I think we're going to have to
accept Federation control...

972
01:24:04,366 --> 01:24:06,843
for the time being.

973
01:24:08,597 --> 01:24:10,661
That is something I cannot do.

974
01:24:17,972 --> 01:24:20,531
He was trained in the Jedi arts.

975
01:24:20,669 --> 01:24:24,563
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

976
01:24:24,694 --> 01:24:26,061
Impossible.

977
01:24:26,187 --> 01:24:28,841
The Sith have been extinct
for a millennium.

978
01:24:28,966 --> 01:24:33,107
I do not believe the Sith could
have returned without us knowing.

979
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:36,304
Hard to see,
the dark side is.

980
01:24:36,433 --> 01:24:39,288
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

981
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:42,606
We will discover the identity
ofyour attacker.

982
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:44,391
May the  force be with you.

983
01:24:48,423 --> 01:24:49,873
Master Qui-Gon.

984
01:24:50,746 --> 01:24:52,527
More to say have you?

985
01:24:54,646 --> 01:24:56,509
With your permission, my master...

986
01:24:58,047 --> 01:25:01,031
I have encountered
a vergence in the  force.

987
01:25:02,154 --> 01:25:04,136
A vergence, you say.

988
01:25:04,271 --> 01:25:06,382
Located around a person?

989
01:25:06,511 --> 01:25:07,749
A boy.

990
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:10,357
His cells have the highest
concentration of midi-chlorians...

991
01:25:10,493 --> 01:25:12,274
I have seen in a life-form.

992
01:25:12,402 --> 01:25:15,257
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

993
01:25:16,965 --> 01:25:20,811
You refer to the prophecy of the one
who will bring balance to the  force.

994
01:25:21,611 --> 01:25:23,723
You believe it's this boy?

995
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:26,411
- I don't presume to--
- But you do.

996
01:25:27,171 --> 01:25:29,117
Revealed your opinion is.

997
01:25:29,245 --> 01:25:31,273
I request the boy be tested,
Master.

998
01:25:33,393 --> 01:25:36,578
Trained as a Jedi
you request for him, hmm?

999
01:25:36,712 --> 01:25:39,071
Finding him
was the will of the  force.

1000
01:25:39,201 --> 01:25:41,430
I have no doubt of that.

1001
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,108
Bring him before us, then.

1002
01:26:01,147 --> 01:26:03,011
The boy's here to see Padmé.

1003
01:26:03,139 --> 01:26:04,708
Lethim in.

1004
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:11,756
I'm sorry, Ani, but Padmé's
not here right now.

1005
01:26:11,892 --> 01:26:13,543
Who is it?

1006
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:17,324
Anakin Skywalker to see Padmé,
Your Highness.

1007
01:26:17,451 --> 01:26:19,232
I've sent Padmé on an errand.

1008
01:26:19,359 --> 01:26:21,222
I'm on my way
to the Jedi temple...

1009
01:26:21,351 --> 01:26:23,581
to start my training, I hope.

1010
01:26:24,421 --> 01:26:28,232
I may never see her again,
so I came to say goodbye.

1011
01:26:29,316 --> 01:26:32,914
We will tell her foryou.
We are sure her heart goes with you.

1012
01:26:34,046 --> 01:26:35,071
Thankyou, Your Highness.

1013
01:26:49,022 --> 01:26:53,080
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

1014
01:26:59,849 --> 01:27:03,200
Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate...

1015
01:27:04,331 --> 01:27:06,690
a tragedy has occurred...

1016
01:27:06,820 --> 01:27:10,300
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...

1017
01:27:10,429 --> 01:27:13,413
and has now engulfed
our entire planet...

1018
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:15,521
in the oppression
of the Trade Federation.

1019
01:27:16,402 --> 01:27:17,805
This is outrageous!

1020
01:27:17,937 --> 01:27:20,461
I object
to the senator's statements.

1021
01:27:20,592 --> 01:27:24,615
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.

1022
01:27:24,742 --> 01:27:28,588
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala...

1023
01:27:28,724 --> 01:27:30,705
recently elected
ruler of the Naboo...

1024
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,703
who speaks on our behalf.

1025
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:41,416
Honourable representatives
of the Republic...

1026
01:27:42,165 --> 01:27:44,608
I come to you under the gravest
of circumstances.

1027
01:27:44,738 --> 01:27:47,593
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade--

1028
01:27:47,725 --> 01:27:51,240
I object!
There is no proof!

1029
01:27:51,375 --> 01:27:53,238
This is incredible.

1030
01:27:53,366 --> 01:27:57,294
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

1031
01:27:57,432 --> 01:27:58,705
The Congress of Malastare...

1032
01:27:58,842 --> 01:28:01,826
concurs with the honourable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

1033
01:28:01,953 --> 01:28:03,982
A commission must be appointed.

1034
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:06,589
- The point--
- Excuse me, Chancellor.

1035
01:28:06,725 --> 01:28:08,340
Enter the bureaucrat.

1036
01:28:08,467 --> 01:28:11,074
The true rulers of the Republic.

1037
01:28:11,205 --> 01:28:15,346
And on the payroll
of the Trade Federation, I might add.

1038
01:28:15,478 --> 01:28:19,666
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.

1039
01:28:21,244 --> 01:28:23,521
The point is conceded.

1040
01:28:23,651 --> 01:28:26,258
Will you deferyour motion
to allow a commission...

1041
01:28:26,389 --> 01:28:29,161
to explore the validity
ofyour accusations?

1042
01:28:29,293 --> 01:28:31,156
I will not defer.

1043
01:28:31,284 --> 01:28:34,764
I've come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now.

1044
01:28:34,894 --> 01:28:37,878
I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die...

1045
01:28:38,005 --> 01:28:40,659
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

1046
01:28:43,606 --> 01:28:45,918
If this body
is not capable of action...

1047
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:48,082
I suggest new leadership is needed.

1048
01:28:51,488 --> 01:28:53,682
I move for a vote
of no confidence...

1049
01:28:53,811 --> 01:28:55,792
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

1050
01:29:02,814 --> 01:29:04,960
Vote now! Vote now!

1051
01:29:08,746 --> 01:29:10,644
Order!

1052
01:29:10,779 --> 01:29:13,634
Now they will elect
a new chancellor...

1053
01:29:13,766 --> 01:29:15,629
a strong chancellor...

1054
01:29:15,757 --> 01:29:18,658
one who will not
let our tragedy continue.

1055
01:29:20,362 --> 01:29:24,587
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.

1056
01:29:24,718 --> 01:29:27,820
Anakin will become a Jedi,
I promise you.

1057
01:29:27,954 --> 01:29:30,644
Do not defy the council,
Master, not again.

1058
01:29:30,775 --> 01:29:33,465
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

1059
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:39,108
Ifyou would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

1060
01:29:39,238 --> 01:29:41,266
They will not go along
with you this time.

1061
01:29:42,765 --> 01:29:45,324
You still have much to learn,
myyoung apprentice.

1062
01:29:48,614 --> 01:29:49,981
A ship.

1063
01:29:51,601 --> 01:29:53,547
A cup.

1064
01:29:53,675 --> 01:29:55,456
A ship.

1065
01:29:56,579 --> 01:29:58,029
A speeder.

1066
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:07,438
How feel you?

1067
01:30:08,029 --> 01:30:09,680
Cold, sir.

1068
01:30:11,348 --> 01:30:13,494
- Afraid are you?
- No, sir.

1069
01:30:14,667 --> 01:30:17,274
See through you we can.

1070
01:30:17,405 --> 01:30:19,268
Be mindful ofyour feelings.

1071
01:30:19,396 --> 01:30:22,132
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

1072
01:30:23,794 --> 01:30:25,197
I miss her.

1073
01:30:26,449 --> 01:30:28,891
Afraid to lose her,
I think, mmm?

1074
01:30:29,021 --> 01:30:31,132
What has that got to do
with anything?

1075
01:30:31,261 --> 01:30:33,573
Everything.

1076
01:30:33,709 --> 01:30:36,729
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1077
01:30:36,862 --> 01:30:39,717
Fear leads to anger.
Anger leads to hate.

1078
01:30:39,848 --> 01:30:43,164
Hate leads to suffering.

1079
01:30:49,681 --> 01:30:52,582
I sense much fear in you.

1080
01:31:05,446 --> 01:31:08,796
Yousa tinking
yousa people ganna die?

1081
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:10,251
I don't know.

1082
01:31:11,585 --> 01:31:13,448
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1083
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:17,928
I hope not.

1084
01:31:18,721 --> 01:31:20,915
Gungans no die'n without a fight.

1085
01:31:21,044 --> 01:31:22,908
Wesa warriors.

1086
01:31:23,036 --> 01:31:26,268
Wesa got a grand army.

1087
01:31:26,396 --> 01:31:29,581
Dat's whyyou no liken us,
mesa tinks.

1088
01:31:29,715 --> 01:31:31,036
Your Highness?

1089
01:31:33,697 --> 01:31:35,808
Your Highness...

1090
01:31:35,937 --> 01:31:39,004
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...

1091
01:31:39,132 --> 01:31:40,499
as supreme chancellor.

1092
01:31:40,625 --> 01:31:44,472
A surprise, to be sure,
but a welcome one.

1093
01:31:44,608 --> 01:31:48,961
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1094
01:31:49,089 --> 01:31:50,740
Who else has been nominated?

1095
01:31:50,872 --> 01:31:55,142
Bail Antilles ofAlderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1096
01:31:55,270 --> 01:32:00,154
I feel confident our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1097
01:32:01,866 --> 01:32:03,848
I will be chancellor.

1098
01:32:03,982 --> 01:32:06,541
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats, Senator...

1099
01:32:06,679 --> 01:32:09,864
there'll be nothing left
of our people, our way of life.

1100
01:32:09,997 --> 01:32:11,860
I understand your concern,
Your Majesty.

1101
01:32:11,989 --> 01:32:15,504
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1102
01:32:17,299 --> 01:32:21,062
Senator, this is your arena.

1103
01:32:21,447 --> 01:32:23,346
I feel I must return to mine.

1104
01:32:26,592 --> 01:32:28,868
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1105
01:32:28,998 --> 01:32:29,858
Go back?

1106
01:32:29,994 --> 01:32:32,932
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.
They'll  force you to sign the treaty.

1107
01:32:33,063 --> 01:32:35,422
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1108
01:32:35,552 --> 01:32:38,324
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1109
01:32:38,456 --> 01:32:40,025
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

1110
01:32:40,157 --> 01:32:42,433
- Ready my ship.
- Please, Your Majesty.

1111
01:32:42,563 --> 01:32:44,427
Stay here where it's safe.

1112
01:32:45,924 --> 01:32:49,073
It is clear to me now that
the Republic no longer functions.

1113
01:32:49,824 --> 01:32:53,929
I prayyou will bring sanity
and compassion back to the senate.

1114
01:33:03,597 --> 01:33:06,156
The  force is strong with him.

1115
01:33:06,294 --> 01:33:08,192
He is to be trained, then?

1116
01:33:10,318 --> 01:33:12,677
No, he will not be trained.

1117
01:33:12,807 --> 01:33:14,458
No?

1118
01:33:16,499 --> 01:33:18,527
He is too old.

1119
01:33:18,656 --> 01:33:22,419
He is the chosen one.
You must see it.

1120
01:33:23,593 --> 01:33:27,108
Clouded this boy's future is.

1121
01:33:29,318 --> 01:33:31,134
I will train him, then.

1122
01:33:35,458 --> 01:33:38,277
I take Anakin
as my Padawan learner.

1123
01:33:38,403 --> 01:33:41,304
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

1124
01:33:41,431 --> 01:33:43,791
Impossible to take on a second.

1125
01:33:43,921 --> 01:33:45,572
The code forbids it.

1126
01:33:45,705 --> 01:33:49,055
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

1127
01:33:49,190 --> 01:33:52,788
Our own counsel we will keep
on who is ready.

1128
01:33:53,795 --> 01:33:56,402
He is headstrong and he has much
to learn of the living  force...

1129
01:33:56,532 --> 01:33:58,230
but he is capable.

1130
01:33:58,358 --> 01:34:00,339
There is little more
he can learn from me.

1131
01:34:02,922 --> 01:34:06,685
Young Skywalker's fate
will be decided later.

1132
01:34:06,821 --> 01:34:09,380
Now is not the time for this.

1133
01:34:10,182 --> 01:34:12,128
The senate is voting
for a new supreme chancellor...

1134
01:34:12,256 --> 01:34:14,910
and Queen Amidala
is returning home...

1135
01:34:15,035 --> 01:34:18,220
which puts pressure on the Federation
and could widen the confrontation.

1136
01:34:18,354 --> 01:34:20,630
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1137
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:25,114
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.

1138
01:34:26,403 --> 01:34:27,936
This is the clue we need...

1139
01:34:28,062 --> 01:34:30,621
to unravel
the mystery of the Sith.

1140
01:34:31,339 --> 01:34:33,533
May the  force be with you.

1141
01:34:46,648 --> 01:34:49,503
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

1142
01:34:49,635 --> 01:34:51,498
From your point ofview.

1143
01:34:51,626 --> 01:34:54,976
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1144
01:34:55,110 --> 01:34:57,965
His fate is uncertain.
He's not dangerous.

1145
01:34:58,097 --> 01:35:00,456
The council will decide
Anakin's future.

1146
01:35:00,586 --> 01:35:03,488
That should be enough foryou.
Now get on board.

1147
01:35:09,133 --> 01:35:12,861
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

1148
01:35:12,991 --> 01:35:15,185
You won't be, Ani.

1149
01:35:15,314 --> 01:35:17,212
I'm not allowed to train you...

1150
01:35:17,347 --> 01:35:19,375
so I want you to watch me
and be mindful.

1151
01:35:19,504 --> 01:35:21,568
Always remember:

1152
01:35:22,491 --> 01:35:25,099
Your focus determines your reality.

1153
01:35:25,230 --> 01:35:28,793
Stay close to me
and you'll be safe.

1154
01:35:28,922 --> 01:35:30,289
Master, sir...

1155
01:35:30,415 --> 01:35:33,978
I heard Yoda talking
about midi-chlorians.

1156
01:35:34,107 --> 01:35:37,587
I've been wondering--
What are midi-chlorians?

1157
01:35:38,878 --> 01:35:41,237
Midi-chlorians are
a microscopic life-form...

1158
01:35:41,367 --> 01:35:43,597
that resides
within all living cells.

1159
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:47,915
- They live inside me?
- Inside your cells, yes.

1160
01:35:48,047 --> 01:35:51,479
- And we are symbionts with them.
- Symbionts?

1161
01:35:51,614 --> 01:35:55,460
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.

1162
01:35:55,597 --> 01:35:58,452
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist...

1163
01:35:58,583 --> 01:36:01,355
and we would have
no knowledge of the  force.

1164
01:36:01,487 --> 01:36:03,351
They continually speak to us...

1165
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:06,134
telling us the will of the  force.

1166
01:36:06,259 --> 01:36:08,323
When you learn
to quiet your mind...

1167
01:36:08,458 --> 01:36:10,321
you'll hear them speaking to you.

1168
01:36:10,449 --> 01:36:12,312
I don't understand.

1169
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:15,920
With time and training, Ani,
you will. You will.

1170
01:36:19,949 --> 01:36:23,678
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure
to continue to serve and protect you.

1171
01:36:24,388 --> 01:36:25,791
I welcome your help.

1172
01:36:25,923 --> 01:36:29,603
Senator Palpatine fears that
the Federation means to destroy me.

1173
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:32,724
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.

1174
01:36:32,851 --> 01:36:35,706
Wesa goin' home!

1175
01:36:35,838 --> 01:36:37,701
Come on, R2.

1176
01:36:47,911 --> 01:36:50,270
Is theplanetsecure?

1177
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:54,246
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1178
01:36:54,382 --> 01:36:57,449
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1179
01:36:57,576 --> 01:37:00,725
Good. I willsee to it
thatin thesenate...

1180
01:37:00,853 --> 01:37:03,755
thingsstayas theyare.

1181
01:37:03,883 --> 01:37:07,363
Iamsendingmy apprentice,
Darth Maul, tojoinyou.

1182
01:37:07,492 --> 01:37:09,355
Yes, my lord.

1183
01:37:09,483 --> 01:37:11,346
A Sith here?

1184
01:37:16,743 --> 01:37:19,185
Those are the forward stabilizers.

1185
01:37:19,315 --> 01:37:21,674
And those two control the pitch?

1186
01:37:23,257 --> 01:37:25,120
You catch on pretty quick.

1187
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:26,982
As soon as we land...

1188
01:37:27,115 --> 01:37:29,722
the Federation will arrest you
and  force you to sign the treaty.

1189
01:37:29,853 --> 01:37:30,878
I agree.

1190
01:37:31,014 --> 01:37:33,750
I'm not sure what you wish
to accomplish by this.

1191
01:37:33,876 --> 01:37:36,318
I will take back what's ours.

1192
01:37:37,112 --> 01:37:39,258
There are too few of us,
Your Highness.

1193
01:37:39,394 --> 01:37:41,257
We have no army.

1194
01:37:41,385 --> 01:37:42,752
And I can only protect you.

1195
01:37:42,878 --> 01:37:44,907
I can't fight a war foryou.

1196
01:37:45,949 --> 01:37:46,974
JarJar Binks.

1197
01:37:47,899 --> 01:37:50,045
Mesa, Your Highness?

1198
01:37:50,181 --> 01:37:53,082
Yes. I need your help.

1199
01:37:58,311 --> 01:38:00,505
I have one battleship on my scope.

1200
01:38:00,634 --> 01:38:02,662
It's a droid control ship.

1201
01:38:02,792 --> 01:38:04,987
They've probably spotted us.

1202
01:38:05,116 --> 01:38:06,814
We haven't much time.

1203
01:38:18,473 --> 01:38:21,127
JarJar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.

1204
01:38:21,253 --> 01:38:22,526
Good.

1205
01:38:22,663 --> 01:38:24,893
Do you think
the queen's idea will work?

1206
01:38:25,029 --> 01:38:26,644
The Gungans will not
be easily swayed.

1207
01:38:28,721 --> 01:38:31,033
And we cannot use our power
to help her.

1208
01:38:32,828 --> 01:38:35,895
I'm sorry for
my behaviour, Master.

1209
01:38:36,022 --> 01:38:39,702
It's not my place to disagree
with you about the boy.

1210
01:38:41,622 --> 01:38:44,890
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1211
01:38:46,062 --> 01:38:47,925
You've been a good apprentice,
Obi-Wan.

1212
01:38:49,381 --> 01:38:52,035
And you're a much wiser man
than I am.

1213
01:38:52,741 --> 01:38:56,056
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.

1214
01:39:09,004 --> 01:39:11,363
Desa nobody dare!

1215
01:39:11,493 --> 01:39:13,639
The Gungan city is deserted!

1216
01:39:13,774 --> 01:39:16,298
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

1217
01:39:16,429 --> 01:39:19,496
Do you think they have been taken
to the camps?

1218
01:39:19,623 --> 01:39:21,935
More likely they were wiped out.

1219
01:39:22,071 --> 01:39:25,092
- Mesa no tink so.
- Do you know where they are,JarJar?

1220
01:39:25,225 --> 01:39:28,622
When in trouble,
Gungans go to sacred place.

1221
01:39:28,751 --> 01:39:31,606
Mesa showyou.
Come on. Mesa showyou!

1222
01:39:49,867 --> 01:39:53,430
Your Honour,
Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1223
01:40:00,072 --> 01:40:03,388
Heyo dadee
Big Boss Nass, Your Honour.

1224
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:06,574
JarJar Binks.

1225
01:40:07,084 --> 01:40:10,316
Who's da uss-en uthers?

1226
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:13,176
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1227
01:40:14,011 --> 01:40:16,405
I come before you in peace.

1228
01:40:16,542 --> 01:40:19,361
Ah, Naboo biggen.

1229
01:40:19,487 --> 01:40:22,636
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

1230
01:40:22,764 --> 01:40:26,445
Yousa all bombad.

1231
01:40:27,329 --> 01:40:30,148
We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.

1232
01:40:30,274 --> 01:40:31,641
Your Honour.

1233
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:36,738
Whosa dis?

1234
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:39,064
I am Queen Amidala.

1235
01:40:40,728 --> 01:40:42,297
This is my decoy...

1236
01:40:42,429 --> 01:40:46,028
my protection,
my loyal bodyguard.

1237
01:40:46,163 --> 01:40:50,433
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.

1238
01:40:50,561 --> 01:40:53,085
Although we do not always agree,
Your Honour...

1239
01:40:53,215 --> 01:40:55,739
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1240
01:40:57,530 --> 01:41:00,679
The Trade Federation has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

1241
01:41:00,807 --> 01:41:04,040
Ifwe do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.

1242
01:41:04,168 --> 01:41:06,362
I askyou to help us.

1243
01:41:06,491 --> 01:41:09,181
No, I beg you to help us.

1244
01:41:09,312 --> 01:41:11,671
We are your humble servants.

1245
01:41:14,912 --> 01:41:17,684
Our fate is in your hands.

1246
01:41:34,826 --> 01:41:39,050
Yousa no tinken yousa
greater den da Gungans?

1247
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:45,398
Mesa lika dis!

1248
01:41:46,442 --> 01:41:47,302
Maybe...

1249
01:41:47,438 --> 01:41:49,962
wesa...

1250
01:41:50,093 --> 01:41:51,956
being friends.

1251
01:42:00,629 --> 01:42:02,410
We've sent our patrols.

1252
01:42:02,538 --> 01:42:05,971
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1253
01:42:06,106 --> 01:42:08,252
It won't be long, my lord.

1254
01:42:08,388 --> 01:42:11,490
This is
an unexpectedmove forher.

1255
01:42:11,624 --> 01:42:13,605
It's too aggressive.

1256
01:42:13,739 --> 01:42:16,133
Lord Maul, be mindful.

1257
01:42:16,270 --> 01:42:18,794
Let them make the firstmove.

1258
01:42:18,925 --> 01:42:20,788
Yes, my master.

1259
01:42:24,319 --> 01:42:25,970
Deysa comin!

1260
01:42:26,102 --> 01:42:27,423
All right!

1261
01:42:30,998 --> 01:42:32,696
They're here!

1262
01:42:32,823 --> 01:42:34,190
Good. They made it.

1263
01:42:38,755 --> 01:42:41,409
Yousa doen grand.

1264
01:42:41,534 --> 01:42:44,602
JarJar bring uss-en
and da Naboo together.

1265
01:42:44,730 --> 01:42:46,593
Oh, no, no, no.

1266
01:42:46,721 --> 01:42:49,659
So, wesa make you...

1267
01:42:49,791 --> 01:42:52,268
bombad general.

1268
01:42:52,404 --> 01:42:53,807
General?

1269
01:42:56,884 --> 01:42:58,334
Captain.

1270
01:42:58,461 --> 01:43:01,020
- Your Highness.
- What is the situation?

1271
01:43:01,157 --> 01:43:03,020
Almost everyone's in camps.

1272
01:43:03,148 --> 01:43:06,334
A few hundred police and guards formed
an underground resistance movement.

1273
01:43:06,468 --> 01:43:08,992
I brought back as many
of the leaders as I could.

1274
01:43:09,123 --> 01:43:11,978
The Federation army's also
much larger than we thought...

1275
01:43:12,110 --> 01:43:13,761
and much stronger.

1276
01:43:15,055 --> 01:43:18,122
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1277
01:43:18,249 --> 01:43:20,443
The battle is a diversion.

1278
01:43:20,572 --> 01:43:23,428
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1279
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:25,093
R2.

1280
01:43:26,215 --> 01:43:29,647
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

1281
01:43:29,783 --> 01:43:31,481
Once we get
to the main entrance...

1282
01:43:31,608 --> 01:43:34,675
Captain Panaka
will create a diversion.

1283
01:43:34,802 --> 01:43:37,703
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

1284
01:43:38,453 --> 01:43:41,225
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1285
01:43:41,357 --> 01:43:43,008
What do you think, Master Jedi?

1286
01:43:43,141 --> 01:43:45,288
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1287
01:43:45,423 --> 01:43:47,900
The difficulty is getting
into the throne room.

1288
01:43:48,037 --> 01:43:50,313
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1289
01:43:50,443 --> 01:43:55,126
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

1290
01:43:55,255 --> 01:43:58,522
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1291
01:43:58,657 --> 01:44:01,759
We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.

1292
01:44:01,892 --> 01:44:03,756
We will send
what pilots we have...

1293
01:44:03,884 --> 01:44:06,904
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1294
01:44:07,037 --> 01:44:10,057
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1295
01:44:10,190 --> 01:44:13,292
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.

1296
01:44:13,426 --> 01:44:15,041
There's an even bigger danger.

1297
01:44:15,168 --> 01:44:17,031
If the viceroy escapes,
Your Highness...

1298
01:44:17,159 --> 01:44:19,353
he will return
with another droid army.

1299
01:44:19,482 --> 01:44:22,667
Well, that is why we must not fail
to get the viceroy.

1300
01:44:22,801 --> 01:44:24,700
Everything depends on it.

1301
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:32,627
She ismore foolish
than I thought.

1302
01:44:32,758 --> 01:44:34,704
We are sending all troops...

1303
01:44:34,832 --> 01:44:37,687
to meet this army
assembling near the swamp.

1304
01:44:37,819 --> 01:44:40,426
It appears to be made up
of primitives.

1305
01:44:40,557 --> 01:44:43,081
This will work to ouradvantage.

1306
01:44:43,212 --> 01:44:45,985
I have your approval
to proceed, then, my lord?

1307
01:44:46,781 --> 01:44:48,479
Wipe them out.

1308
01:44:50,182 --> 01:44:52,045
Allofthem.

1309
01:45:22,789 --> 01:45:24,157
Halt!

1310
01:45:27,603 --> 01:45:29,832
Starting up the shield.

1311
01:45:59,214 --> 01:46:00,405
Open fire.

1312
01:46:16,431 --> 01:46:19,616
Once we get inside, you find
a safe place to hide and stay there.

1313
01:46:19,749 --> 01:46:21,647
- Sure.
- Stay there.

1314
01:46:37,547 --> 01:46:39,575
Roger, roger.

1315
01:46:47,587 --> 01:46:50,689
I thought the battle was going
to take place far from here.

1316
01:46:51,777 --> 01:46:53,263
This is too close.

1317
01:46:59,202 --> 01:47:01,561
Ani, find cover.

1318
01:47:01,691 --> 01:47:03,968
- Quick!
- Get to your ships!

1319
01:48:02,427 --> 01:48:03,535
Fighters straight ahead.

1320
01:48:03,672 --> 01:48:04,780
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1321
01:48:04,917 --> 01:48:06,108
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1322
01:48:14,748 --> 01:48:15,821
Cease fire.

1323
01:48:23,335 --> 01:48:25,730
Steady. Steady.

1324
01:48:58,681 --> 01:49:01,866
- Activate the droids.
- Yes, sir.

1325
01:49:18,304 --> 01:49:20,202
Ouch time.

1326
01:49:34,235 --> 01:49:35,308
Fire!

1327
01:49:57,467 --> 01:49:59,283
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.

1328
01:49:59,417 --> 01:50:00,867
Red group! Blue group!

1329
01:50:00,993 --> 01:50:02,774
Everybody, this way!

1330
01:50:02,901 --> 01:50:04,930
Hey, wait for me!

1331
01:50:05,059 --> 01:50:07,418
Anakin, stay where you are.
You'll be safe there.

1332
01:50:07,548 --> 01:50:09,529
- But l--
- Stay in that cockpit.

1333
01:50:21,653 --> 01:50:24,839
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.

1334
01:50:44,927 --> 01:50:46,825
We gotta do something, R2.

1335
01:51:09,528 --> 01:51:12,512
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!

1336
01:51:15,958 --> 01:51:18,978
Oops, wrong one.
Maybe it's this one.

1337
01:51:19,982 --> 01:51:20,355
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1338
01:51:20,355 --> 01:51:22,419
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1339
01:51:24,629 --> 01:51:25,572
Yeah!

1340
01:51:30,935 --> 01:51:32,421
Let's go!

1341
01:51:33,507 --> 01:51:35,736
It's on automatic pilot.

1342
01:51:44,791 --> 01:51:46,654
Try to override it.

1343
01:52:46,397 --> 01:52:48,295
We don't have time for this,
Captain.

1344
01:52:54,404 --> 01:52:56,220
Look, there they are.

1345
01:52:56,353 --> 01:52:58,712
That's where
the autopilot's taking us.

1346
01:53:15,644 --> 01:53:18,251
Dumb droid. Take that!

1347
01:53:18,382 --> 01:53:20,280
Get off! Get off! Get off!

1348
01:53:20,415 --> 01:53:21,571
Get off!

1349
01:53:31,575 --> 01:53:33,934
The deflector shield
is too strong.

1350
01:53:43,190 --> 01:53:44,842
This is tense!

1351
01:53:47,132 --> 01:53:49,113
R2, get us off this autopilot.

1352
01:53:49,248 --> 01:53:51,111
It's gonna get us both killed.

1353
01:53:52,774 --> 01:53:55,168
You did it, R2!

1354
01:53:55,305 --> 01:53:56,496
Let's go left.

1355
01:54:01,693 --> 01:54:02,801
Go back?

1356
01:54:02,938 --> 01:54:07,209
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

1357
01:54:14,056 --> 01:54:16,498
I'll try spinning.
That's a good trick.

1358
01:54:22,146 --> 01:54:24,671
I know we're in trouble.
Just hang on.

1359
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:32,470
Go!

1360
01:54:37,288 --> 01:54:38,986
Ascension guns!

1361
01:56:44,484 --> 01:56:46,099
Retreat! Retreat!

1362
01:56:47,844 --> 01:56:49,742
Dis is nutsen.

1363
01:56:59,584 --> 01:57:01,530
Uh-oh. Big boomers.

1364
01:57:22,152 --> 01:57:24,547
Give me a lift!

1365
01:57:31,778 --> 01:57:33,347
JarJar, usen da booma!

1366
01:57:33,478 --> 01:57:35,376
What?
Mesa no have a booma!

1367
01:57:35,511 --> 01:57:37,457
Here. Taken dis one.

1368
01:57:53,806 --> 01:57:54,879
JarJar!

1369
01:57:55,009 --> 01:57:56,955
Jump,JarJar, jump!

1370
01:58:07,082 --> 01:58:09,854
Put down your weapons.
They win this round.

1371
01:58:22,721 --> 01:58:24,833
We're hit, R2!

1372
01:58:37,988 --> 01:58:40,926
I'm trying to stop!
I'm trying to stop!

1373
01:58:48,111 --> 01:58:49,644
Everything's overheated.

1374
01:58:51,098 --> 01:58:53,044
Oops. This is not good.

1375
02:00:05,109 --> 02:00:07,303
No giben up, General JarJar.

1376
02:00:07,432 --> 02:00:09,295
Mesa think of something.

1377
02:00:09,423 --> 02:00:10,790
Hands up.

1378
02:00:10,917 --> 02:00:13,772
My give up. My give up.

1379
02:00:22,449 --> 02:00:25,553
Your little insurrection
is at an end, Your Highness.

1380
02:00:25,686 --> 02:00:27,549
Time foryou
to sign the treaty and end...

1381
02:00:27,677 --> 02:00:29,540
this pointless debate in the senate.

1382
02:00:29,669 --> 02:00:31,403
Viceroy!

1383
02:00:31,535 --> 02:00:33,433
Your occupation here has ended.

1384
02:00:35,020 --> 02:00:38,370
After her.
This one's a decoy.

1385
02:00:44,936 --> 02:00:46,386
Captain!

1386
02:00:55,597 --> 02:00:57,625
Jam the doors.

1387
02:01:01,073 --> 02:01:03,928
Now, Viceroy,
we will discuss a new treaty.

1388
02:02:06,787 --> 02:02:09,264
Yes! We have power.
Shields up.

1389
02:02:12,553 --> 02:02:13,578
Take this!

1390
02:02:15,581 --> 02:02:16,654
And this!

1391
02:02:24,501 --> 02:02:26,235
- Oops.
- We're losing power.

1392
02:02:26,368 --> 02:02:28,184
There seems to be a problem
with the main reactor.

1393
02:02:28,318 --> 02:02:29,685
Impossible!

1394
02:02:29,811 --> 02:02:31,674
Nothing can get through our shield.

1395
02:02:32,964 --> 02:02:34,745
Let's get outta here.

1396
02:02:42,754 --> 02:02:45,362
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!

1397
02:02:48,397 --> 02:02:49,966
We didn't hit it.

1398
02:02:53,043 --> 02:02:55,071
Now, this is Podracing.

1399
02:02:56,694 --> 02:02:58,392
Look, one of ours,
out of the main hold!

1400
02:03:19,677 --> 02:03:21,127
What the--

1401
02:03:21,253 --> 02:03:23,447
Was'n they doing?

1402
02:03:23,576 --> 02:03:27,140
The control ship
has been destroyed. Look!

1403
02:03:28,846 --> 02:03:31,158
They all broke-ed.

1404
02:04:19,333 --> 02:04:22,683
No, it's too late.

1405
02:04:22,818 --> 02:04:25,095
- No.
- Obi-Wan.

1406
02:04:26,386 --> 02:04:28,249
Promise--

1407
02:04:28,378 --> 02:04:30,902
Promise me
you will train the boy.

1408
02:04:31,033 --> 02:04:32,566
Yes, Master.

1409
02:04:36,633 --> 02:04:39,192
He is the chosen one.

1410
02:04:39,329 --> 02:04:42,514
He will bring balance.

1411
02:04:43,727 --> 02:04:45,131
Train him.

1412
02:05:12,518 --> 02:05:14,299
Now, Viceroy...

1413
02:05:14,426 --> 02:05:17,823
you're going to have to go back
to the senate and explain all this.

1414
02:05:19,570 --> 02:05:22,837
I thinkyou can kiss
your trade franchise goodbye.

1415
02:05:36,497 --> 02:05:40,012
We are indebted to you
foryour bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1416
02:05:40,147 --> 02:05:42,010
And you, young Skywalker.

1417
02:05:42,802 --> 02:05:46,070
We will watch your career
with great interest.

1418
02:05:52,593 --> 02:05:55,117
Congratulations on your election,
Chancellor.

1419
02:05:55,248 --> 02:05:58,645
Your boldness has saved our people,
Your Majesty.

1420
02:05:58,774 --> 02:06:01,133
It's you who should be
congratulated.

1421
02:06:01,264 --> 02:06:05,158
Together we shall bring peace
and prosperity to the Republic.

1422
02:06:10,184 --> 02:06:14,572
Confer on you the level
of Jedi knight the council does.

1423
02:06:14,705 --> 02:06:19,388
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...

1424
02:06:19,517 --> 02:06:21,380
I do not.

1425
02:06:21,509 --> 02:06:23,573
Qui-Gon believed in him.

1426
02:06:26,488 --> 02:06:29,142
The chosen one the boy may be.

1427
02:06:29,267 --> 02:06:30,882
Nevertheless...

1428
02:06:31,009 --> 02:06:33,864
grave danger I fear
in his training.

1429
02:06:33,996 --> 02:06:38,101
Master Yoda,
I gave Qui-Gon my word.

1430
02:06:38,227 --> 02:06:40,125
I will train Anakin.

1431
02:06:42,376 --> 02:06:44,689
Without the approval
of the council, if I must.

1432
02:06:44,824 --> 02:06:47,266
Qui-Gon's defiance
I sense in you.

1433
02:06:47,396 --> 02:06:49,294
Need that you do not.

1434
02:06:51,545 --> 02:06:54,777
Agree with you the council does.

1435
02:06:55,901 --> 02:06:59,168
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.

1436
02:07:26,849 --> 02:07:28,583
What will happen to me now?

1437
02:07:28,716 --> 02:07:31,736
The council have granted me
permission to train you.

1438
02:07:31,869 --> 02:07:35,266
You will be a Jedi, I promise.

1439
02:07:44,647 --> 02:07:47,997
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.

1440
02:07:48,131 --> 02:07:50,573
Always two there are.

1441
02:07:50,703 --> 02:07:53,888
No more, no less.

1442
02:07:54,022 --> 02:07:56,923
A master and an apprentice.

1443
02:07:57,050 --> 02:07:58,583
But which was destroyed?

1444
02:07:58,710 --> 02:08:01,648
The master or the apprentice?

1445
02:08:26,174 --> 02:08:28,202
Hidoe, everybody!

1446
02:09:14,587 --> 02:09:16,485
Peace!

- Yay!

3
00:00:23,014 --> 00:00:24,721
I can't believe it.

4
00:00:24,848 --> 00:00:26,756
The crowds are going nuts!

5
00:00:35,687 --> 00:00:37,725
Yay, Ani!

6
00:00:39,064 --> 00:00:42,098
Mom, I did it! Yay!

7
00:00:52,613 --> 00:00:54,485
Good going, Ani!

8
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:00,822
We owe you everything, Ani.

9
00:01:03,452 --> 00:01:05,573
It's so wonderful, Ani.

10
00:01:05,703 --> 00:01:08,407
You have brought hope
to those who have none.

11
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:10,744
I'm so very proud ofyou.

12
00:01:21,212 --> 00:01:23,084
You!

13
00:01:23,213 --> 00:01:25,500
You swindled me.

14
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,413
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehowyou knew it.

15
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,422
I lost everything.

16
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:35,083
Wheneveryou gamble, my friend,
eventuallyyou lose.

17
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:37,673
Bring the parts
to the main hangar.

18
00:01:37,804 --> 00:01:40,886
I'll come byyour shop later on
so you can release the boy.

19
00:01:41,014 --> 00:01:44,297
You can't have him.
It wasn't a fair bet.

20
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:50,508
Would you like to discuss it
with the Hutts?

21
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:53,134
I'm sure they can settle this.

22
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,519
Take him.

23
00:02:03,484 --> 00:02:04,514
Hidoe!

24
00:02:06,152 --> 00:02:08,226
Well, we have all
the essential parts we need.

25
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:09,393
I'm going back.

26
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,604
Some unfinished business.
I won't be long.

27
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:15,188
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?

28
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:19,109
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.

29
00:02:19,243 --> 00:02:21,115
Get this hyperdrive
generator installed.

30
00:02:21,244 --> 00:02:23,780
Yes, Master.
That shouldn't take long.

31
00:02:23,912 --> 00:02:26,069
Come on. Hup!

32
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,580
Hey. These are yours.

33
00:02:34,585 --> 00:02:35,829
Yes!

34
00:02:37,514 --> 00:02:40,264
Mom, we sold the pod!
Look at all the money we have!

35
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:42,761
My goodness!
But that's so wonderful, Ani.

36
00:02:42,892 --> 00:02:45,844
- And he has been freed.
- What?

37
00:02:45,977 --> 00:02:47,767
You're no longer a slave.

38
00:02:49,688 --> 00:02:51,596
Did you hear that?

39
00:02:52,397 --> 00:02:54,851
Nowyou can make
your dreams come true, Ani.

40
00:02:55,732 --> 00:02:57,640
You are free.

41
00:03:01,235 --> 00:03:02,692
Will you take him with you?

42
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,442
Is he to become a Jedi?

43
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,106
Yes. Our meeting
was not a coincidence.

44
00:03:07,947 --> 00:03:09,607
Nothing happens by accident.

45
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,272
You mean I get to come with you
in your starship?

46
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:14,819
Anakin...

47
00:03:16,744 --> 00:03:20,027
training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge...

48
00:03:20,162 --> 00:03:23,031
and even ifyou succeed,
it's a hard life.

49
00:03:23,163 --> 00:03:26,328
But I wanna go. It's what
I've always dreamed of doing.

50
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,287
Can I go, Mom?

51
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,910
Anakin...

52
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:34,959
this path has been placed
before you.

53
00:03:35,087 --> 00:03:37,541
The choice is yours alone.

54
00:03:41,215 --> 00:03:43,087
I wanna do it.

55
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:47,880
Then packyour things.
We haven't much time.

56
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:56,090
What about Mom?

57
00:03:59,225 --> 00:04:01,097
Is she free too?

58
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:04,722
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

59
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:07,725
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Mom?

60
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:19,065
Son, my place is here.
My future is here.

61
00:04:19,194 --> 00:04:21,564
It is time foryou to let go.

62
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,816
I don't want things to change.

63
00:04:24,946 --> 00:04:27,316
But you can't stop the change...

64
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:30,531
any more than you can
stop the suns from setting.

65
00:04:31,617 --> 00:04:33,525
I love you.

66
00:04:39,204 --> 00:04:41,076
Now hurry.

67
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:47,999
Thankyou.

68
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:51,042
I'll watch after him.
You have my word.

69
00:04:53,295 --> 00:04:54,788
Will you be all right?

70
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:57,712
Yeah.

71
00:05:02,758 --> 00:05:04,334
Hello, Master Anakin.

72
00:05:04,468 --> 00:05:06,542
Well, 3PO, I've been freed...

73
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:09,047
and I'm going away in a starship.

74
00:05:09,178 --> 00:05:12,095
Master Anakin, you are my maker
and I wish you well.

75
00:05:12,222 --> 00:05:16,431
However, I should prefer it
if I were a little more completed.

76
00:05:16,558 --> 00:05:19,676
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to finish you, 3PO...

77
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:21,847
give you coverings and all.

78
00:05:21,977 --> 00:05:23,600
I'm gonna miss working on you.

79
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:26,182
You've been a great pal.

80
00:05:26,313 --> 00:05:28,933
I'll make sure Mom
doesn't sell you or anything.

81
00:05:29,731 --> 00:05:30,762
Sell me?

82
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:32,522
Bye.

83
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,024
Oh, my.

84
00:05:58,664 --> 00:06:00,869
I can't do it, Mom.
I just can't do it.

85
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:07,158
Will I ever see you again?

86
00:06:08,627 --> 00:06:11,497
What does your heart tell you?

87
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:14,746
I hope so.

88
00:06:15,506 --> 00:06:17,378
Yes.

89
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:19,083
I guess.

90
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:22,705
Then we will
see each other again.

91
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:28,213
I will come back
and free you, Mom.

92
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,053
I promise.

93
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,262
Now, be brave...

94
00:06:42,062 --> 00:06:44,053
and don't look back.

95
00:06:44,855 --> 00:06:46,727
Don't look back.

96
00:07:31,297 --> 00:07:32,375
Qui-Gon, sir, wait!

97
00:07:32,506 --> 00:07:34,248
- I'm tired!
- Anakin! Drop!

98
00:07:36,716 --> 00:07:37,664
Go!

99
00:07:38,717 --> 00:07:40,625
Tell them to take off!

100
00:07:53,225 --> 00:07:54,682
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

101
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:57,351
Take off.

102
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,803
Over there. Fly low.

103
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:24,406
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

104
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:26,074
What was it?

105
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:27,943
I'm not sure...

106
00:08:28,077 --> 00:08:30,613
but it was well-trained
in the Jedi arts.

107
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:33,241
My guess is
it was after the queen.

108
00:08:33,372 --> 00:08:35,861
What are we gonna do about it?

109
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:39,455
We shall be patient.

110
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:40,697
Anakin Skywalker...

111
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:42,624
meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

112
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:47,580
You're a Jedi too?
Pleased to meet you.

113
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:59,087
Your queen is lost,
your people are starving...

114
00:08:59,219 --> 00:09:01,210
and you, Governor,
are going to die...

115
00:09:01,345 --> 00:09:03,466
much sooner than your people,
I'm afraid.

116
00:09:03,596 --> 00:09:06,085
This invasion
will gain you nothing.

117
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:09,221
We're a democracy.
The people have decided.

118
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,222
Take him away.

119
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:17,140
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...

120
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,806
for these rumoured
underwater villages.

121
00:09:19,938 --> 00:09:22,558
They will not
stay hidden for long.

122
00:09:33,612 --> 00:09:36,315
The death toll is catastrophic.

123
00:09:36,447 --> 00:09:39,067
We mustbow to their wishes.

124
00:09:39,198 --> 00:09:41,403
You must contactme.

125
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,449
You all right?

126
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,408
It's very cold.

127
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,130
You come from
a warm planet, Ani.

128
00:10:11,257 --> 00:10:13,628
A little too warm
for my taste.

129
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,999
Space is cold.

130
00:10:16,135 --> 00:10:18,256
You seem sad.

131
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:21,668
The queen is worried.

132
00:10:21,804 --> 00:10:24,210
Her people are suffering, dying.

133
00:10:24,347 --> 00:10:27,844
She must convince the senate
to intervene or...

134
00:10:29,308 --> 00:10:31,596
I'm not sure what'll happen.

135
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:35,099
I made this foryou...

136
00:10:36,604 --> 00:10:38,476
so you'd remember me.

137
00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:41,856
I carved it
out of a japor snippet.

138
00:10:41,982 --> 00:10:44,815
It'll bring you good fortune.

139
00:10:44,942 --> 00:10:46,814
It's beautiful.

140
00:10:46,943 --> 00:10:49,313
But I don't need this
to rememberyou by.

141
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:56,355
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani...

142
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,026
but my caring foryou will remain.

143
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:04,861
I care foryou, too, only l--

144
00:11:04,994 --> 00:11:07,151
Miss your mother.

145
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,791
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

146
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:31,666
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

147
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,049
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

148
00:12:04,526 --> 00:12:07,560
It is a great gift
to see you alive, Your Majesty.

149
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:10,646
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.

150
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:13,234
I'm anxious to hearyour report
on the situation.

151
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,985
May I present
Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

152
00:12:16,116 --> 00:12:18,072
Welcome, Your Highness.

153
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,238
It's an honour to finally
meet you in person.

154
00:12:20,368 --> 00:12:21,825
Thankyou, Supreme Chancellor.

155
00:12:21,952 --> 00:12:25,449
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

156
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,993
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hearyour position.

157
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:33,248
I'm grateful foryour concern,
Chancellor.

158
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,247
There is a question
of procedure...

159
00:12:35,376 --> 00:12:37,865
but I'm confident
we can overcome it.

160
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:40,868
I must speak with the Jedi Council
immediately.

161
00:12:41,004 --> 00:12:43,789
The situation has become
much more complicated.

162
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,458
Ani, come on.

163
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:05,385
Da queen's a bein grossly nice,
mesa tinks.

164
00:13:06,726 --> 00:13:08,682
Pitty hot.

165
00:13:36,576 --> 00:13:39,694
There is no civility,
only politics.

166
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:44,860
The Republic
is not what it once was.

167
00:13:44,997 --> 00:13:50,237
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

168
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:54,456
There is no interest
in the common good.

169
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:56,959
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

170
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,790
There is little chance the senate
will act on the invasion.

171
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:02,624
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

172
00:14:02,756 --> 00:14:04,628
If I may say so, Your Majesty...

173
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:06,962
the chancellor
has little real power.

174
00:14:07,092 --> 00:14:10,957
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.

175
00:14:11,094 --> 00:14:14,841
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?

176
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:18,466
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

177
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:20,803
of a stronger
supreme chancellor...

178
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:23,090
one who could control
the bureaucrats...

179
00:14:23,225 --> 00:14:25,050
and give usjustice.

180
00:14:25,935 --> 00:14:31,436
You could call for a vote of
no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.

181
00:14:31,563 --> 00:14:34,053
He has been
our strongest supporter.

182
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:39,394
Our only other choice would be
to submit a plea to the courts.

183
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:42,857
The courts take even longer
to decide things than the senate.

184
00:14:43,778 --> 00:14:45,852
Our people are dying, Senator.

185
00:14:46,655 --> 00:14:49,654
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

186
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:52,270
To be realistic, Your Majesty...

187
00:14:52,407 --> 00:14:54,897
I think we're going to have to
accept Federation control...

188
00:14:55,035 --> 00:14:57,524
for the time being.

189
00:14:59,287 --> 00:15:01,361
That is something I cannot do.

190
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,280
He was trained in the Jedi arts.

191
00:15:11,418 --> 00:15:15,331
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

192
00:15:15,462 --> 00:15:16,836
Impossible.

193
00:15:16,963 --> 00:15:19,630
The Sith have been extinct
for a millennium.

194
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:23,917
I do not believe the Sith could
have returned without us knowing.

195
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:27,130
Hard to see,
the dark side is.

196
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,129
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

197
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:33,463
We will discover the identity
ofyour attacker.

198
00:15:33,597 --> 00:15:35,256
May the  force be with you.

199
00:15:39,308 --> 00:15:40,765
Master Qui-Gon.

200
00:15:41,643 --> 00:15:43,433
More to say have you?

201
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:47,433
With your permission, my master...

202
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:51,978
I have encountered
a vergence in the  force.

203
00:15:53,106 --> 00:15:55,098
A vergence, you say.

204
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:57,355
Located around a person?

205
00:15:57,485 --> 00:15:58,729
A boy.

206
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,349
His cells have the highest
concentration of midi-chlorians...

207
00:16:01,487 --> 00:16:03,277
I have seen in a life-form.

208
00:16:03,404 --> 00:16:06,273
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

209
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:11,855
You refer to the prophecy of the one
who will bring balance to the  force.

210
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:14,781
You believe it's this boy?

211
00:16:14,911 --> 00:16:17,483
- I don't presume to--
- But you do.

212
00:16:18,246 --> 00:16:20,202
Revealed your opinion is.

213
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,368
I request the boy be tested,
Master.

214
00:16:24,499 --> 00:16:27,700
Trained as a Jedi
you request for him, hmm?

215
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:30,204
Finding him
was the will of the  force.

216
00:16:30,335 --> 00:16:32,575
I have no doubt of that.

217
00:16:39,257 --> 00:16:41,295
Bring him before us, then.

218
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:54,261
The boy's here to see Padmé.

219
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,966
Lethim in.

220
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:03,049
I'm sorry, Ani, but Padmé's
not here right now.

221
00:17:03,186 --> 00:17:04,845
Who is it?

222
00:17:05,646 --> 00:17:08,645
Anakin Skywalker to see Padmé,
Your Highness.

223
00:17:08,772 --> 00:17:10,562
I've sent Padmé on an errand.

224
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,562
I'm on my way
to the Jedi temple...

225
00:17:12,691 --> 00:17:14,932
to start my training, I hope.

226
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:19,606
I may never see her again,
so I came to say goodbye.

227
00:17:20,696 --> 00:17:24,312
We will tell her foryou.
We are sure her heart goes with you.

228
00:17:25,448 --> 00:17:26,478
Thankyou, Your Highness.

229
00:17:40,498 --> 00:17:44,576
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

230
00:17:51,378 --> 00:17:54,746
Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate...

231
00:17:55,882 --> 00:17:58,252
a tragedy has occurred...

232
00:17:58,383 --> 00:18:01,880
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...

233
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:05,008
and has now engulfed
our entire planet...

234
00:18:05,136 --> 00:18:07,127
in the oppression
of the Trade Federation.

235
00:18:08,012 --> 00:18:09,422
This is outrageous!

236
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,091
I object
to the senator's statements.

237
00:18:12,223 --> 00:18:16,266
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.

238
00:18:16,392 --> 00:18:20,257
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala...

239
00:18:20,394 --> 00:18:22,385
recently elected
ruler of the Naboo...

240
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,392
who speaks on our behalf.

241
00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:33,149
Honourable representatives
of the Republic...

242
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:36,356
I come to you under the gravest
of circumstances.

243
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:39,356
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade--

244
00:18:39,488 --> 00:18:43,020
I object!
There is no proof!

245
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,028
This is incredible.

246
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:49,104
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

247
00:18:49,243 --> 00:18:50,522
The Congress of Malastare...

248
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,659
concurs with the honourable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

249
00:18:53,787 --> 00:18:55,826
A commission must be appointed.

250
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:58,444
- The point--
- Excuse me, Chancellor.

251
00:18:58,582 --> 00:19:00,205
Enter the bureaucrat.

252
00:19:00,332 --> 00:19:02,952
The true rulers of the Republic.

253
00:19:03,084 --> 00:19:07,245
And on the payroll
of the Trade Federation, I might add.

254
00:19:07,378 --> 00:19:11,587
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.

255
00:19:13,172 --> 00:19:15,460
The point is conceded.

256
00:19:15,591 --> 00:19:18,211
Will you deferyour motion
to allow a commission...

257
00:19:18,342 --> 00:19:21,127
to explore the validity
ofyour accusations?

258
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,132
I will not defer.

259
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:26,758
I've come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now.

260
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:29,887
I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die...

261
00:19:30,015 --> 00:19:32,682
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

262
00:19:35,643 --> 00:19:37,967
If this body
is not capable of action...

263
00:19:38,103 --> 00:19:40,141
I suggest new leadership is needed.

264
00:19:43,564 --> 00:19:45,769
I move for a vote
of no confidence...

265
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:47,889
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

266
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:57,102
Vote now! Vote now!

267
00:20:00,907 --> 00:20:02,815
Order!

268
00:20:02,949 --> 00:20:05,818
Now they will elect
a new chancellor...

269
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:07,823
a strong chancellor...

270
00:20:07,952 --> 00:20:10,867
one who will not
let our tragedy continue.

271
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:16,824
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.

272
00:20:16,957 --> 00:20:20,075
Anakin will become a Jedi,
I promise you.

273
00:20:20,209 --> 00:20:22,912
Do not defy the council,
Master, not again.

274
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:25,746
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

275
00:20:27,671 --> 00:20:31,417
Ifyou would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

276
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:33,585
They will not go along
with you this time.

277
00:20:35,092 --> 00:20:37,664
You still have much to learn,
myyoung apprentice.

278
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,344
A ship.

279
00:20:43,971 --> 00:20:45,927
A cup.

280
00:20:46,056 --> 00:20:47,846
A ship.

281
00:20:48,974 --> 00:20:50,431
A speeder.

282
00:20:57,979 --> 00:20:59,887
How feel you?

283
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,139
Cold, sir.

284
00:21:03,815 --> 00:21:05,972
- Afraid are you?
- No, sir.

285
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,770
See through you we can.

286
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,773
Be mindful ofyour feelings.

287
00:21:11,902 --> 00:21:14,652
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

288
00:21:16,322 --> 00:21:17,732
I miss her.

289
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,444
Afraid to lose her,
I think, mmm?

290
00:21:21,575 --> 00:21:23,696
What has that got to do
with anything?

291
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:26,150
Everything.

292
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,319
Fear is the path to the dark side.

293
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,323
Fear leads to anger.
Anger leads to hate.

294
00:21:32,455 --> 00:21:35,787
Hate leads to suffering.

295
00:21:42,336 --> 00:21:45,251
I sense much fear in you.

296
00:21:58,178 --> 00:22:01,545
Yousa tinking
yousa people ganna die?

297
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,007
I don't know.

298
00:22:04,348 --> 00:22:06,220
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

299
00:22:08,683 --> 00:22:10,721
I hope not.

300
00:22:11,518 --> 00:22:13,723
Gungans no die'n without a fight.

301
00:22:13,852 --> 00:22:15,725
Wesa warriors.

302
00:22:15,854 --> 00:22:19,102
Wesa got a grand army.

303
00:22:19,231 --> 00:22:22,432
Dat's whyyou no liken us,
mesa tinks.

304
00:22:22,566 --> 00:22:23,893
Your Highness?

305
00:22:26,568 --> 00:22:28,689
Your Highness...

306
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:31,901
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...

307
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:33,403
as supreme chancellor.

308
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:37,395
A surprise, to be sure,
but a welcome one.

309
00:22:37,532 --> 00:22:41,907
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

310
00:22:42,035 --> 00:22:43,694
Who else has been nominated?

311
00:22:43,827 --> 00:22:48,118
Bail Antilles ofAlderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

312
00:22:48,246 --> 00:22:53,154
I feel confident our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.

313
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,866
I will be chancellor.

314
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,573
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats, Senator...

315
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,912
there'll be nothing left
of our people, our way of life.

316
00:23:03,046 --> 00:23:04,918
I understand your concern,
Your Majesty.

317
00:23:05,047 --> 00:23:08,579
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

318
00:23:10,383 --> 00:23:14,165
Senator, this is your arena.

319
00:23:14,551 --> 00:23:16,460
I feel I must return to mine.

320
00:23:19,722 --> 00:23:22,009
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

321
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:23,004
Go back?

322
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,092
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.
They'll  force you to sign the treaty.

323
00:23:26,225 --> 00:23:28,595
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

324
00:23:28,726 --> 00:23:31,511
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

325
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:33,220
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

326
00:23:33,353 --> 00:23:35,640
- Ready my ship.
- Please, Your Majesty.

327
00:23:35,771 --> 00:23:37,644
Stay here where it's safe.

328
00:23:39,149 --> 00:23:42,314
It is clear to me now that
the Republic no longer functions.

329
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:47,192
I prayyou will bring sanity
and compassion back to the senate.

330
00:23:56,908 --> 00:23:59,480
The  force is strong with him.

331
00:23:59,618 --> 00:24:01,526
He is to be trained, then?

332
00:24:03,662 --> 00:24:06,032
No, he will not be trained.

333
00:24:06,163 --> 00:24:07,822
No?

334
00:24:09,873 --> 00:24:11,911
He is too old.

335
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:15,823
He is the chosen one.
You must see it.

336
00:24:17,002 --> 00:24:20,534
Clouded this boy's future is.

337
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:24,580
I will train him, then.

338
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,758
I take Anakin
as my Padawan learner.

339
00:24:31,885 --> 00:24:34,800
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

340
00:24:34,928 --> 00:24:37,299
Impossible to take on a second.

341
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,089
The code forbids it.

342
00:24:39,223 --> 00:24:42,590
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

343
00:24:42,724 --> 00:24:46,340
Our own counsel we will keep
on who is ready.

344
00:24:47,351 --> 00:24:49,971
He is headstrong and he has much
to learn of the living  force...

345
00:24:50,103 --> 00:24:51,810
but he is capable.

346
00:24:51,937 --> 00:24:53,928
There is little more
he can learn from me.

347
00:24:56,524 --> 00:25:00,306
Young Skywalker's fate
will be decided later.

348
00:25:00,442 --> 00:25:03,014
Now is not the time for this.

349
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:05,775
The senate is voting
for a new supreme chancellor...

350
00:25:05,903 --> 00:25:08,570
and Queen Amidala
is returning home...

351
00:25:08,696 --> 00:25:11,897
which puts pressure on the Federation
and could widen the confrontation.

352
00:25:12,031 --> 00:25:14,318
And draw out the queen's attacker.

353
00:25:14,449 --> 00:25:18,825
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.

354
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,660
This is the clue we need...

355
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:24,359
to unravel
the mystery of the Sith.

356
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,285
May the  force be with you.

357
00:25:40,464 --> 00:25:43,333
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

358
00:25:43,465 --> 00:25:45,337
From your point ofview.

359
00:25:45,466 --> 00:25:48,833
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

360
00:25:48,968 --> 00:25:51,837
His fate is uncertain.
He's not dangerous.

361
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:54,339
The council will decide
Anakin's future.

362
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,387
That should be enough foryou.
Now get on board.

363
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:06,805
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

364
00:26:06,936 --> 00:26:09,141
You won't be, Ani.

365
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,178
I'm not allowed to train you...

366
00:26:11,313 --> 00:26:13,351
so I want you to watch me
and be mindful.

367
00:26:13,481 --> 00:26:15,555
Always remember:

368
00:26:16,482 --> 00:26:19,103
Your focus determines your reality.

369
00:26:19,234 --> 00:26:22,814
Stay close to me
and you'll be safe.

370
00:26:22,945 --> 00:26:24,319
Master, sir...

371
00:26:24,445 --> 00:26:28,025
I heard Yoda talking
about midi-chlorians.

372
00:26:28,155 --> 00:26:31,652
I've been wondering--
What are midi-chlorians?

373
00:26:32,949 --> 00:26:35,319
Midi-chlorians are
a microscopic life-form...

374
00:26:35,451 --> 00:26:37,692
that resides
within all living cells.

375
00:26:39,162 --> 00:26:42,031
- They live inside me?
- Inside your cells, yes.

376
00:26:42,163 --> 00:26:45,612
- And we are symbionts with them.
- Symbionts?

377
00:26:45,748 --> 00:26:49,613
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.

378
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,619
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist...

379
00:26:52,752 --> 00:26:55,537
and we would have
no knowledge of the  force.

380
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,543
They continually speak to us...

381
00:26:57,672 --> 00:27:00,339
telling us the will of the  force.

382
00:27:00,465 --> 00:27:02,539
When you learn
to quiet your mind...

383
00:27:02,674 --> 00:27:04,546
you'll hear them speaking to you.

384
00:27:04,675 --> 00:27:06,547
I don't understand.

385
00:27:06,676 --> 00:27:10,173
With time and training, Ani,
you will. You will.

386
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:17,968
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure
to continue to serve and protect you.

387
00:27:18,683 --> 00:27:20,093
I welcome your help.

388
00:27:20,225 --> 00:27:23,923
Senator Palpatine fears that
the Federation means to destroy me.

389
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:27,060
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.

390
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:30,056
Wesa goin' home!

391
00:27:30,189 --> 00:27:32,061
Come on, R2.

392
00:27:42,321 --> 00:27:44,691
Is theplanetsecure?

393
00:27:44,822 --> 00:27:48,687
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

394
00:27:48,824 --> 00:27:51,906
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

395
00:27:52,034 --> 00:27:55,199
Good. I willsee to it
thatin thesenate...

396
00:27:55,327 --> 00:27:58,244
thingsstayas theyare.

397
00:27:58,371 --> 00:28:01,868
Iamsendingmy apprentice,
Darth Maul, tojoinyou.

398
00:28:01,998 --> 00:28:03,870
Yes, my lord.

399
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:05,871
A Sith here?

400
00:28:11,294 --> 00:28:13,748
Those are the forward stabilizers.

401
00:28:13,878 --> 00:28:16,248
And those two control the pitch?

402
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,712
You catch on pretty quick.

403
00:28:19,841 --> 00:28:21,583
As soon as we land...

404
00:28:21,717 --> 00:28:24,337
the Federation will arrest you
and  force you to sign the treaty.

405
00:28:24,468 --> 00:28:25,498
I agree.

406
00:28:25,635 --> 00:28:28,385
I'm not sure what you wish
to accomplish by this.

407
00:28:28,512 --> 00:28:30,966
I will take back what's ours.

408
00:28:31,763 --> 00:28:33,920
There are too few of us,
Your Highness.

409
00:28:34,056 --> 00:28:35,928
We have no army.

410
00:28:36,057 --> 00:28:37,431
And I can only protect you.

411
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:39,597
I can't fight a war foryou.

412
00:28:40,644 --> 00:28:41,674
JarJar Binks.

413
00:28:42,603 --> 00:28:44,760
Mesa, Your Highness?

414
00:28:44,896 --> 00:28:47,811
Yes. I need your help.

415
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:55,271
I have one battleship on my scope.

416
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:57,439
It's a droid control ship.

417
00:28:57,568 --> 00:28:59,774
They've probably spotted us.

418
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,611
We haven't much time.

419
00:29:13,327 --> 00:29:15,994
JarJar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.

420
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,399
Good.

421
00:29:17,537 --> 00:29:19,778
Do you think
the queen's idea will work?

422
00:29:19,915 --> 00:29:21,538
The Gungans will not
be easily swayed.

423
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:25,949
And we cannot use our power
to help her.

424
00:29:27,752 --> 00:29:30,834
I'm sorry for
my behaviour, Master.

425
00:29:30,962 --> 00:29:34,660
It's not my place to disagree
with you about the boy.

426
00:29:36,589 --> 00:29:39,873
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

427
00:29:41,051 --> 00:29:42,923
You've been a good apprentice,
Obi-Wan.

428
00:29:44,386 --> 00:29:47,053
And you're a much wiser man
than I am.

429
00:29:47,762 --> 00:29:51,093
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.

430
00:30:04,105 --> 00:30:06,475
Desa nobody dare!

431
00:30:06,606 --> 00:30:08,763
The Gungan city is deserted!

432
00:30:08,899 --> 00:30:11,435
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

433
00:30:11,567 --> 00:30:14,649
Do you think they have been taken
to the camps?

434
00:30:14,777 --> 00:30:17,101
More likely they were wiped out.

435
00:30:17,236 --> 00:30:20,271
- Mesa no tink so.
- Do you know where they are,JarJar?

436
00:30:20,405 --> 00:30:23,819
When in trouble,
Gungans go to sacred place.

437
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:26,818
Mesa showyou.
Come on. Mesa showyou!

438
00:30:45,168 --> 00:30:48,748
Your Honour,
Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

439
00:30:55,423 --> 00:30:58,755
Heyo dadee
Big Boss Nass, Your Honour.

440
00:30:59,551 --> 00:31:01,957
JarJar Binks.

441
00:31:02,469 --> 00:31:05,717
Who's da uss-en uthers?

442
00:31:06,305 --> 00:31:08,592
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

443
00:31:09,431 --> 00:31:11,837
I come before you in peace.

444
00:31:11,974 --> 00:31:14,807
Ah, Naboo biggen.

445
00:31:14,934 --> 00:31:18,099
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

446
00:31:18,227 --> 00:31:21,926
Yousa all bombad.

447
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:25,647
We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.

448
00:31:25,773 --> 00:31:27,147
Your Honour.

449
00:31:29,317 --> 00:31:32,269
Whosa dis?

450
00:31:32,402 --> 00:31:34,607
I am Queen Amidala.

451
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:37,855
This is my decoy...

452
00:31:37,988 --> 00:31:41,605
my protection,
my loyal bodyguard.

453
00:31:41,741 --> 00:31:46,032
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.

454
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,695
Although we do not always agree,
Your Honour...

455
00:31:48,827 --> 00:31:51,363
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

456
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:56,328
The Trade Federation has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

457
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,705
Ifwe do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.

458
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,039
I askyou to help us.

459
00:32:02,168 --> 00:32:04,871
No, I beg you to help us.

460
00:32:05,003 --> 00:32:07,373
We are your humble servants.

461
00:32:10,631 --> 00:32:13,416
Our fate is in your hands.

462
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:34,885
Yousa no tinken yousa
greater den da Gungans?

463
00:32:37,353 --> 00:32:41,266
Mesa lika dis!

464
00:32:42,315 --> 00:32:43,180
Maybe...

465
00:32:43,315 --> 00:32:45,851
wesa...

466
00:32:45,983 --> 00:32:47,855
being friends.

467
00:32:56,572 --> 00:32:58,362
We've sent our patrols.

468
00:32:58,489 --> 00:33:01,939
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

469
00:33:02,075 --> 00:33:04,232
It won't be long, my lord.

470
00:33:04,368 --> 00:33:07,486
This is
an unexpectedmove forher.

471
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,611
It's too aggressive.

472
00:33:09,746 --> 00:33:12,152
Lord Maul, be mindful.

473
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:14,825
Let them make the firstmove.

474
00:33:14,956 --> 00:33:16,828
Yes, my master.

475
00:33:20,377 --> 00:33:22,036
Deysa comin!

476
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:23,496
All right!

477
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,795
They're here!

478
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,297
Good. They made it.

479
00:33:34,884 --> 00:33:37,551
Yousa doen grand.

480
00:33:37,677 --> 00:33:40,760
JarJar bring uss-en
and da Naboo together.

481
00:33:40,888 --> 00:33:42,760
Oh, no, no, no.

482
00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:45,841
So, wesa make you...

483
00:33:45,974 --> 00:33:48,463
bombad general.

484
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,010
General?

485
00:33:53,102 --> 00:33:54,559
Captain.

486
00:33:54,686 --> 00:33:57,258
- Your Highness.
- What is the situation?

487
00:33:57,396 --> 00:33:59,268
Almost everyone's in camps.

488
00:33:59,397 --> 00:34:02,599
A few hundred police and guards formed
an underground resistance movement.

489
00:34:02,733 --> 00:34:05,269
I brought back as many
of the leaders as I could.

490
00:34:05,401 --> 00:34:08,270
The Federation army's also
much larger than we thought...

491
00:34:08,402 --> 00:34:10,061
and much stronger.

492
00:34:11,362 --> 00:34:14,444
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

493
00:34:14,572 --> 00:34:16,777
The battle is a diversion.

494
00:34:16,906 --> 00:34:19,776
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

495
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:21,450
R2.

496
00:34:22,577 --> 00:34:26,026
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

497
00:34:26,162 --> 00:34:27,869
Once we get
to the main entrance...

498
00:34:27,996 --> 00:34:31,078
Captain Panaka
will create a diversion.

499
00:34:31,206 --> 00:34:34,121
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

500
00:34:34,874 --> 00:34:37,659
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

501
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:39,451
What do you think, Master Jedi?

502
00:34:39,585 --> 00:34:41,743
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

503
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,368
The difficulty is getting
into the throne room.

504
00:34:44,505 --> 00:34:46,792
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

505
00:34:46,923 --> 00:34:51,629
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

506
00:34:51,759 --> 00:34:55,042
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

507
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:58,295
We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.

508
00:34:58,428 --> 00:35:00,301
We will send
what pilots we have...

509
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:03,464
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

510
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,633
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

511
00:35:06,767 --> 00:35:09,885
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.

512
00:35:10,018 --> 00:35:11,641
There's an even bigger danger.

513
00:35:11,769 --> 00:35:13,641
If the viceroy escapes,
Your Highness...

514
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,975
he will return
with another droid army.

515
00:35:16,105 --> 00:35:19,306
Well, that is why we must not fail
to get the viceroy.

516
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,349
Everything depends on it.

517
00:35:26,694 --> 00:35:29,314
She ismore foolish
than I thought.

518
00:35:29,446 --> 00:35:31,402
We are sending all troops...

519
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,399
to meet this army
assembling near the swamp.

520
00:35:34,531 --> 00:35:37,151
It appears to be made up
of primitives.

521
00:35:37,283 --> 00:35:39,819
This will work to ouradvantage.

522
00:35:39,951 --> 00:35:42,737
I have your approval
to proceed, then, my lord?

523
00:35:43,537 --> 00:35:45,244
Wipe them out.

524
00:35:46,955 --> 00:35:48,827
Allofthem.

525
00:36:19,722 --> 00:36:21,097
Halt!

526
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:26,799
Starting up the shield.

527
00:36:56,325 --> 00:36:57,522
Open fire.

528
00:37:13,626 --> 00:37:16,827
Once we get inside, you find
a safe place to hide and stay there.

529
00:37:16,961 --> 00:37:18,869
- Sure.
- Stay there.

530
00:37:34,846 --> 00:37:36,884
Roger, roger.

531
00:37:44,935 --> 00:37:48,053
I thought the battle was going
to take place far from here.

532
00:37:49,145 --> 00:37:50,638
This is too close.

533
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,977
Ani, find cover.

534
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:01,397
- Quick!
- Get to your ships!

535
00:39:00,141 --> 00:39:01,255
Fighters straight ahead.

536
00:39:01,393 --> 00:39:02,507
Roger, Bravo Leader.

537
00:39:02,643 --> 00:39:03,840
Roger, Bravo Leader.

538
00:39:12,523 --> 00:39:13,601
Cease fire.

539
00:39:21,152 --> 00:39:23,559
Steady. Steady.

540
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:59,873
- Activate the droids.
- Yes, sir.

541
00:40:16,391 --> 00:40:18,299
Ouch time.

542
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:33,477
Fire!

543
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:57,570
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.

544
00:40:57,704 --> 00:40:59,161
Red group! Blue group!

545
00:40:59,288 --> 00:41:01,078
Everybody, this way!

546
00:41:01,206 --> 00:41:03,245
Hey, wait for me!

547
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:05,745
Anakin, stay where you are.
You'll be safe there.

548
00:41:05,876 --> 00:41:07,867
- But l--
- Stay in that cockpit.

549
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:23,252
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.

550
00:41:43,438 --> 00:41:45,346
We gotta do something, R2.

551
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,158
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!

552
00:42:14,621 --> 00:42:17,655
Oops, wrong one.
Maybe it's this one.

553
00:42:18,664 --> 00:42:19,039
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

554
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,114
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

555
00:42:23,334 --> 00:42:24,282
Yeah!

556
00:42:29,671 --> 00:42:31,164
Let's go!

557
00:42:32,255 --> 00:42:34,495
It's on automatic pilot.

558
00:42:43,595 --> 00:42:45,467
Try to override it.

559
00:43:45,503 --> 00:43:47,411
We don't have time for this,
Captain.

560
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:55,374
Look, there they are.

561
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:57,878
That's where
the autopilot's taking us.

562
00:44:14,894 --> 00:44:17,514
Dumb droid. Take that!

563
00:44:17,645 --> 00:44:19,553
Get off! Get off! Get off!

564
00:44:19,688 --> 00:44:20,850
Get off!

565
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:33,272
The deflector shield
is too strong.

566
00:44:42,575 --> 00:44:44,235
This is tense!

567
00:44:46,536 --> 00:44:48,527
R2, get us off this autopilot.

568
00:44:48,662 --> 00:44:50,534
It's gonna get us both killed.

569
00:44:52,205 --> 00:44:54,611
You did it, R2!

570
00:44:54,748 --> 00:44:55,945
Let's go left.

571
00:45:01,168 --> 00:45:02,282
Go back?

572
00:45:02,419 --> 00:45:06,711
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

573
00:45:13,592 --> 00:45:16,046
I'll try spinning.
That's a good trick.

574
00:45:21,721 --> 00:45:24,258
I know we're in trouble.
Just hang on.

575
00:45:31,101 --> 00:45:32,096
Go!

576
00:45:36,937 --> 00:45:38,644
Ascension guns!

577
00:47:44,757 --> 00:47:46,380
Retreat! Retreat!

578
00:47:48,133 --> 00:47:50,041
Dis is nutsen.

579
00:47:59,931 --> 00:48:01,887
Uh-oh. Big boomers.

580
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:25,016
Give me a lift!

581
00:48:32,282 --> 00:48:33,858
JarJar, usen da booma!

582
00:48:33,991 --> 00:48:35,899
What?
Mesa no have a booma!

583
00:48:36,033 --> 00:48:37,989
Here. Taken dis one.

584
00:48:54,418 --> 00:48:55,496
JarJar!

585
00:48:55,627 --> 00:48:57,583
Jump,JarJar, jump!

586
00:49:07,759 --> 00:49:10,544
Put down your weapons.
They win this round.

587
00:49:23,475 --> 00:49:25,597
We're hit, R2!

588
00:49:38,817 --> 00:49:41,769
I'm trying to stop!
I'm trying to stop!

589
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:50,531
Everything's overheated.

590
00:49:51,991 --> 00:49:53,947
Oops. This is not good.

591
00:51:06,365 --> 00:51:08,570
No giben up, General JarJar.

592
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:10,571
Mesa think of something.

593
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,074
Hands up.

594
00:51:12,201 --> 00:51:15,070
My give up. My give up.

595
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:26,909
Your little insurrection
is at an end, Your Highness.

596
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,914
Time foryou
to sign the treaty and end...

597
00:51:29,043 --> 00:51:30,915
this pointless debate in the senate.

598
00:51:31,044 --> 00:51:32,786
Viceroy!

599
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,828
Your occupation here has ended.

600
00:51:36,422 --> 00:51:39,789
After her.
This one's a decoy.

601
00:51:46,386 --> 00:51:47,843
Captain!

602
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,138
Jam the doors.

603
00:52:02,602 --> 00:52:05,471
Now, Viceroy,
we will discuss a new treaty.

604
00:53:08,638 --> 00:53:11,127
Yes! We have power.
Shields up.

605
00:53:14,433 --> 00:53:15,463
Take this!

606
00:53:17,476 --> 00:53:18,554
And this!

607
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,182
- Oops.
- We're losing power.

608
00:53:28,316 --> 00:53:30,141
There seems to be a problem
with the main reactor.

609
00:53:30,275 --> 00:53:31,649
Impossible!

610
00:53:31,776 --> 00:53:33,648
Nothing can get through our shield.

611
00:53:34,944 --> 00:53:36,734
Let's get outta here.

612
00:53:44,782 --> 00:53:47,403
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!

613
00:53:50,452 --> 00:53:52,028
We didn't hit it.

614
00:53:55,121 --> 00:53:57,159
Now, this is Podracing.

615
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:00,497
Look, one of ours,
out of the main hold!

616
00:54:21,885 --> 00:54:23,342
What the--

617
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:25,674
Was'n they doing?

618
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:29,385
The control ship
has been destroyed. Look!

619
00:54:31,099 --> 00:54:33,423
They all broke-ed.

620
00:55:21,834 --> 00:55:25,201
No, it's too late.

621
00:55:25,336 --> 00:55:27,624
- No.
- Obi-Wan.

622
00:55:28,922 --> 00:55:30,794
Promise--

623
00:55:30,923 --> 00:55:33,459
Promise me
you will train the boy.

624
00:55:33,591 --> 00:55:35,132
Yes, Master.

625
00:55:39,218 --> 00:55:41,790
He is the chosen one.

626
00:55:41,928 --> 00:55:45,129
He will bring balance.

627
00:55:46,347 --> 00:55:47,758
Train him.

628
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,070
Now, Viceroy...

629
00:56:17,197 --> 00:56:20,611
you're going to have to go back
to the senate and explain all this.

630
00:56:22,366 --> 00:56:25,649
I thinkyou can kiss
your trade franchise goodbye.

631
00:56:39,376 --> 00:56:42,908
We are indebted to you
foryour bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

632
00:56:43,044 --> 00:56:44,916
And you, young Skywalker.

633
00:56:45,712 --> 00:56:48,996
We will watch your career
with great interest.

634
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:58,087
Congratulations on your election,
Chancellor.

635
00:56:58,219 --> 00:57:01,633
Your boldness has saved our people,
Your Majesty.

636
00:57:01,763 --> 00:57:04,133
It's you who should be
congratulated.

637
00:57:04,264 --> 00:57:08,177
Together we shall bring peace
and prosperity to the Republic.

638
00:57:13,228 --> 00:57:17,638
Confer on you the level
of Jedi knight the council does.

639
00:57:17,771 --> 00:57:22,477
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...

640
00:57:22,607 --> 00:57:24,479
I do not.

641
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:26,682
Qui-Gon believed in him.

642
00:57:29,611 --> 00:57:32,278
The chosen one the boy may be.

643
00:57:32,405 --> 00:57:34,028
Nevertheless...

644
00:57:34,155 --> 00:57:37,024
grave danger I fear
in his training.

645
00:57:37,157 --> 00:57:41,282
Master Yoda,
I gave Qui-Gon my word.

646
00:57:41,409 --> 00:57:43,317
I will train Anakin.

647
00:57:45,578 --> 00:57:47,903
Without the approval
of the council, if I must.

648
00:57:48,038 --> 00:57:50,492
Qui-Gon's defiance
I sense in you.

649
00:57:50,623 --> 00:57:52,531
Need that you do not.

650
00:57:54,791 --> 00:57:58,039
Agree with you the council does.

651
00:57:59,168 --> 00:58:02,451
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.

652
00:58:30,269 --> 00:58:32,011
What will happen to me now?

653
00:58:32,145 --> 00:58:35,179
The council have granted me
permission to train you.

654
00:58:35,313 --> 00:58:38,727
You will be a Jedi, I promise.

655
00:58:48,154 --> 00:58:51,521
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.

656
00:58:51,655 --> 00:58:54,109
Always two there are.

657
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,441
No more, no less.

658
00:58:57,575 --> 00:59:00,490
A master and an apprentice.

659
00:59:00,618 --> 00:59:02,159
But which was destroyed?

660
00:59:02,286 --> 00:59:05,238
The master or the apprentice?

661
00:59:29,884 --> 00:59:31,922
Hidoe, everybody!

662
01:00:18,535 --> 01:00:20,443
Peace!
