00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,450
Who are you?
We are three wise men.

3
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,330
What?
We are three wise men.

4
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,950
Well, what are you doing creeping around
a cow shed at 2:00 in the morning?

5
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,750
That doesn't sound
very wise to me.

6
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:58,450
We are astrologers.
We have come from the east.
Is this some kind of joke?

7
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,450
We wish to praise the infant.
We must pay homage to him.

8
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,870
Homage? You're drunk!
It's disgusting!

9
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,950
Out the door! Out! Bashing me with
tales about Oriental fortunetellers.

10
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,330
Come on, out!
No, no. We must see him.

11
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,830
Go and praise someone else's brat.
We were led by a star.

12
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,040
Led by a bottle,
more like. Go on out.

13
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,200
We must see him.
We have brought presents.

14
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,540
Out!
Gold, frankincense, myrrh.

15
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,540
Well, why didn't you say?
He's over there.

16
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,250
Sorry the place
is a bit of a mess.

17
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,910
Well, what is myrrh anyway?
It is a valuable balm.

18
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:37,120
A balm? What are you giving him
a balm for? It might bite him.

19
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,330
What?
That's a dangerous animal.

20
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,660
No, it isn't.
Yes, it is.

21
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,450
It's great big and
No, it is an ointment.

22
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,790
Well, there is an animal
called a balm... or did I dream it?

23
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,200
So you're astrologers, are you?
Well, what is he, then?

24
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,080
Hmm?
What star sign is he?

25
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,540
Well, Capricorn.
Capricorn, eh? What are they like?

26
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,200
He is the Son of God,
our Messiah.

27
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,120
King of the Jews!

28
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,540
That's Capricorn, is it?
No, that's just him.

29
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,790
Oh, I was gonna say, otherwise
there would be a lot of them.

30
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,120
By what name are you calling him?
Uh, Brian.

31
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,830
We worship you, O Brian,
who are lord over us all.

32
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:25,200
Praise unto you, Brian, and
to the Lord, our Father. Amen.

33
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,370
You do a lot of this, then?
What?

34
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,540
This praising.
No, no, no, no.

35
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,580
Well, if you're
dropping by again, do pop in.

36
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,290
And thanks a lot for
the gold and frankincense.

37
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,830
But don't worry too much
about the myrrh next time, all right?

38
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,330
Thank you.
Goodbye.

39
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,500
Well, weren't they nice?

40
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:51,450
Out of their bloody minds,
but still... Iook at that!
Here! Here!

41
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,580
That That's mine!
Hey, he's a baby! Oh!

42
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,450
Shut up!

43
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,830
" Brian "

44
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,950
" The babe they called Brian "

45
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,410
" He grew "

46
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,750
" Grew, grew and grew "

47
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,120
" Grew up to be "

48
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,410
" Grew up to be "

49
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,750
" A boy called Brian "

50
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,950
" A boy called Brian "

51
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,200
" He had arms and legs "

52
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,540
" And hands and feet "

53
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,080
" This boy "

54
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,330
" Whose name was Brian "

55
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,620
" And he grew "

56
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,000
" Grew, grew and grew "

57
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,000
" Grew up to be "

58
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,330
" Yes, he grew up to be "

59
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,790
" A teenager called Brian "

60
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,660
" A teenager called Brian "

61
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,080
" And his face became spotty "

62
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,660
" Yes, his face became spotty "

63
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,160
" And his voice
dropped down low "

64
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,620
" And things started to grow "

65
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,870
" On young Brian and show "

66
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,750
" He was certainly no "

67
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,160
" No girl named Brian "

68
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,790
" Not a girl named Brian "

69
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,620
" And he started to shave "

70
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,330
" And have one off the wrist "

71
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:06,200
" And want to see girls "

72
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,870
" And go out and get pissed "

73
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,160
" A man called Brian "

74
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,620
" This man called Brian "

75
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:24,500
" The man they called Brian "

76
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,450
" This man called "

77
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:37,700
" Bri "

78
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,040
Aah!

79
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,000
How blessed are those who know
that He's a god.

80
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,620
How blessed are the sorrowful.
They shall find consolation.

81
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,750
How blessed are those
of gentle spirit.

82
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,080
They shall have the earth
for their possession.

83
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:43,330
How blessed are those
who hunger and thirst...

84
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,200
to see right prevail.

85
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,870
They shall be satisfied.

86
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,330
How blessed are those
whose hearts are pure.

87
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,950
They shall see God.

88
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,120
Speak up!
Shhh. Quiet, Mum.

89
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,950
Well, I can't hear a thing.
Let's go to the stoning.

90
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,910
Shhh!
We can go to a stoning anytime.

91
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,450
Oh, come on, Brian.
Will you be quiet?

92
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,700
Don't pick your nose.

93
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,290
I wasn't picking my nose.
I was scratching.

94
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,000
You was picking it
while you was talking to that lady.

95
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,500
I wasn't.
Leave it alone. Give it a rest.

96
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,200
Do you mind?
I can't hear a word he's saying.

97
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,790
Don't you "do you mind" me!
I was talking to my husband.

98
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,290
Well, go and talk to him somewhere else.
I can't hear a bloody thing.

99
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,330
Don't you swear at my wife.

100
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,620
I was only asking her to shut up so
we can hear what he's saying, Big Nose.

101
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:40,160
Don't you call my husband "Big Nose."
Well, he has got a big nose.

102
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,500
Could you be quiet, please?
What was that?

103
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,910
I was too busy
talking to Big Nose.

104
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,790
I think it was,
"Blessed are the cheese makers."

105
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,910
What's so special
about the cheese makers?

106
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,580
Well, obviously, it's not meant
to be taken literally.

107
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,410
It refers to any manufacturers
of dairy products.

108
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,330
See, if you hadn't been going on,
we'd have heard that, Big Nose.

109
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:02,330
Hey! Say that once more,
I'll smash your bloody face in.

110
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:07,750
Better keep listening. Might be a bit
about, "Blessed are the Big Noses."
Oh, lay off him.

111
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,870
Oh, you're not so bad
yourself, Conch Face.

112
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,120
Where are you two from,
Nose City?

113
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,120
One more time, mate, I'll
take you to fuckin' cleaners!

114
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,540
Language!
And don't pick your nose.

115
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,290
I wasn't gonna pick my nose.
I was gonna thump him!

116
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,250
Hear that? "Blessed are the Greek."
The Greek?

117
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,830
Well, apparently
he's going to inherit the earth.

118
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,750
Did anyone catch his name?
You're not gonna thump anybody.

119
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,620
I'll thump him
if he calls me "Big Nose" again.

120
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,790
Oh, shut up, Big Nose.
Oh! Right. I warned you.

121
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:39,620
I really will slug you so hard
Oh, it's the meek!

122
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,540
"Blessed are the meek"!
Oh, that's nice, isn't it?

123
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,580
I'm glad they're getting something,
'cause they have a hell of a time.

124
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,330
Listen, I'm only telling the truth.
You have got a very big nose.

125
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:54,200
Hey, your nose gonna be three foot wide
across your face when I'm finished!

126
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,290
Shhh!
Who hit yours, then?
Goliath's big brother?

127
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:02,830
Oh. Right.
That's your last warning.
Oh, do pipe down.

128
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,910
Silly bitch.
Get in the way on me.

129
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,410
Oh, come on.
Let's go to the stoning.

130
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,620
All right.

131
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:20,950
Blessed is just about anyone with
a vested interest in the status quo.

132
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,750
Well, what Jesus fails to appreciate
is it's the meek who are the problem.

133
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,870
Yes, yes. Absolutely, Reg.
Yes, I see.

134
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:34,330
Oh, come on, Brian. They're gonna
stone him before we get there.

135
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,250
All right.

136
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,410
That's disgusting.

137
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:45,250
It's the chap with a big nose's fault.
He started it all.

138
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,870
Oh, I hate wearing these beards.

139
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:53,080
Why aren't women allowed
to go to stonings, Mum?
It's written, that's why.

140
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,870
Beard, madame?

141
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:59,580
Oh, look, I haven't got time
to go to no stonings.
He's not well again.

142
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,790
Stone, sir?

143
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,410
No, they got them up there,
lying around on the ground.

144
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,870
Oh, not like these, sir.
Look at this.

145
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,620
Feel the quality of that.
That's craftsmanship, sir.

146
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,450
Well, all right. We'll have two
with points and a big, flat one.

147
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,660
Can I have a flat one, Mum?
Shhh!

148
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,660
Sorry. Dad.
All right.

149
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,660
Two points, two flats
and a packet of gravel.

150
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,120
Packet of gravel. Should be
a good one this afternoon.

151
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,910
Who?
Local boy.

152
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,250
Oh, good.
Enjoy yourselves.

153
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,200
Matthias, son
of Deuteronomy of Gath?

154
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,580
Do I say yes? Yes.
Yes.

155
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,330
You have been found guilty
by the elders of the town...

156
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,450
of uttering
the name of our Lord.

157
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,330
And so as a blasphemer...

158
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,120
you are to be stoned to death.

159
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,540
Look, I'd had a lovely supper,

160
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:12,540
and all I said to my wife was,
"That piece of halibut
was good enough for Jehovah."

161
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,790
Blasphemy! He said it again!

162
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,450
Did you hear him?

163
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,660
Really!

164
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,080
Are there any women
here today?

165
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:38,830
Very well. By virtue
of the authority vested in me

166
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,950
Ow! Lay off!
We haven't started yet!

167
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,120
Come on!
Who threw that?

168
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,790
Who threw that stone?
Come on.

169
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,950
She did! She did!

170
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,120
He did! He did!

171
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,790
Sorry. I thought
we'd started.
Go to the back.

172
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:01,580
Always one, isn't there?
Now, where were we?

173
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,330
Look, I don't think it ought to be
blasphemy, just saying "Jehovah."

174
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,540
You're only making it
worse for yourself.

175
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,620
Making it worse?
How could it be worse?

176
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,330
Jehovah! Jehovah! Jehovah!

177
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,290
I'm warning you, if you say
"Jehovah" once more

178
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,450
Right.
Who threw that?

179
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,160
Come on.
Who threw that?

180
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,450
Him, him, him.

181
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,450
Was it you?
Yes.

182
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,250
Right
Well, you did say "Jehovah."

183
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,620
Stop! Will you stop that?

184
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,620
Stop it! Now, look!
No one is to stone anyone...

185
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,910
until I blow this whistle.

186
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,500
Do you understand? Even and I want
to make this absolutely clear

187
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,950
Even if they do say "Jehovah."

188
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,580
Good shot! Bravo!

189
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,540
Have I got a big nose, Mum?
Oh, stop thinking about sex.

190
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,160
I wasn't!
You're always on about it,
morning, noon and night.

191
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,080
"Will the girls like this?
Will the girls like that?

192
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,830
Is it too big?
ls it too small?"

193
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,120
Here you are, mate.

194
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,370
Bless you, sir.
Alms for the poor.

195
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,830
Alms for a leper.
Alms for an exleper.

196
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,870
Bloody donkey owners.
All the same, ain't they?

197
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,450
Never have any change.
Oh, here's a touch.

198
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,000
Spare a talent for an old exleper?
Buzz off!

199
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,410
Spare a talent
for an old exleper?

200
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,200
A talent?
That's more than he earns in a month!

201
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,370
Half a talent, then.
Now, go away!

202
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,830
Come on, Big Nose, let's haggle.
What?

203
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,410
You open at one shekel.
I start at 2,000. We close about 1,800.

204
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,410
No.
1,750?

205
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,450
Go away!
1,740?

206
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,410
Leave him alone!
All right, two shekels.
Isn't this fun, eh?

207
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,910
Look, he's not giving you
any money, so piss off!

208
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,790
All right. Half a shekel
for an old exleper?
Did you say "exleper"?

209
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,580
Sixteen years behind the bell,
and proud of it, sir.

210
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,290
Well, what happened?
I were cured, sir.

211
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,660
Cured?
Yes, a bloody miracle, sir.

212
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,580
Well, who cured you?
Jesus did, sir.

213
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,080
I was hopping along,
minding my own business.

214
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,540
All of a sudden,
up he comes, cures me!

215
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,580
One minute,
I'm a leper with a trade;

216
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,700
next minute,
my livelihood's gone.

217
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,450
"You're cured, mate."
Bloody dogooder.

218
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,120
Well, why don't you go and tell him
that you want to be a leper again?

219
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,870
I could do that, sir.
Yeah, I could do that, I suppose.

220
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,660
I was gonna ask him if he'd
make me a bit lame in one leg
during the middle of the week.

221
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,330
You know, something beggable but not
leprosy, which is a pain in the ass.

222
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,200
Brian! Come and clean
your room out!

223
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,290
There you are.
Thank you, sir. Thank

224
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:03,200
Half a denary?
Me bloody life story.

225
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,410
There's no pleasing
some people.

226
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,540
That's just
what Jesus said, sir.

227
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,330
Oh!
Good afternoon.

228
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,410
Oh, uh, hello, officer.

229
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,790
I'll be with you in a few
moments, all right, dear?

230
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,580
What's he doing here?
Don't start that, Brian.
Go and clean your room out.

231
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,250
Bloody Romans!
Now look, Brian.

232
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,790
If it wasn't for him,
we wouldn't have all this.

233
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,290
And don't you forget it.
We don't owe the Romans anything, Mum.

234
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,950
Well, that's not entirely true.
What do you mean?

235
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,120
Well, you know you were
asking me about your
My nose?

236
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,370
Yes. Well, there's a reason
it's like it is, Brian.
What is it?

237
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,330
Well, I suppose I should've
told you a long time ago

238
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,660
What?
Well, Brian...

239
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,870
your father
isn't Mr. Cohen.

240
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:09,290
Well, I never thought he was.
None of your cheek!
He was a Roman, Brian.

241
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,410
He was a centurion
in the Roman army.

242
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:16,580
You mean you were raped?
Well, at first, yes.

243
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,620
Who was it?
Naughtius Maximus, his name was.

244
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,250
Promised me
the known world, he did.

245
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:28,450
I was to be taken to Rome,
housed by the Forum
slaves, asses' milk,

246
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,830
as much gold as I could eat.

247
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,410
Then he, having his way
with me, he had

248
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,660
Vroom, like a rat out of an aqueduct!
The bastard!

249
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,950
Yeah, so next time you go on
about the bloody Romans,

250
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,950
don't forget
you're one of 'em!

251
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,160
I'm not a Roman, Mum!
And I never will be!

252
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,160
I'm a kike, a Yid,
a hebe, a hooknose!

253
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:53,080
I'm kosher, Mum! I'm a Red Sea
pedestrian, and proud of it!

254
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,250
Sex, sex, sex. That's all
they think about, huh?

255
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,580
Well, how are you,
then, officer?

256
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:24,620
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next contest...

257
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,620
is between...

258
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:31,370
Frank Goliath,
the Macedonian babycrusher,

259
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,120
and Boris Mineburg.

260
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,750
Larks' tongues.
Wren's livers.

261
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:45,160
Chaffinch brains.
Jaguars' earlobes.

262
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,080
Wolf's nipple chips. Get 'em
while they're hot. They're lovely.

263
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,750
Dromedary pretzels, only half a denar.
Tuscany fried bats.

264
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:55,700
I do feel, Reg, that any
antilmperialist group like ours...

265
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:59,750
must reflect such a divergence
of interest within its power base.

266
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:03,540
Oh, great. Francis?
Yeah, I think Judith's point
of view is very valid, Reg,

267
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,580
provided the movement
never forgets...

268
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,040
that it is the inalienable
right of every man
Or woman.

269
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,700
or woman
to rid himself

270
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,540
Or herself.
or herself

271
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,370
Agreed.
Thank you, brother.

272
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,450
Or sister.
Or sister.

273
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,370
Where was I?

274
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,370
I think you finished.
Oh, right.

275
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,290
Furthermore, it is
the birthright of every man

276
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,370
Or woman.
Why don't you shut up about women?

277
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,620
Women have a perfect right
to play a part in our movement.

278
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:33,620
Why are you always on
about women, Stan?
I want to be one.

279
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,870
What?
I want to be a woman.

280
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,910
From now on, I want you all
to call me "Loretta."

281
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:47,200
What?
It's my right as a man.

282
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,950
Well, why do you want
to be Loretta, Stan?

283
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,620
I want to have babies.

284
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,290
You want to have babies?

285
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,040
It's every man's right
to have babies if he wants them.

286
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,910
But you can't have babies.
Don't you oppress me.

287
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,410
I'm not oppressing you.
You haven't got a womb.

288
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,540
Where is the fetus
gonna gestate?

289
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,040
You're gonna keep it
in a box?

290
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
Here, I've got an idea.

291
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,790
Suppose you agree that
he can't actually have babies,

292
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:21,120
not having a womb which is
nobody's fault, not even the Romans'

293
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,120
but that he can have
the right to have babies?

294
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,950
Good idea, Judith.
We shall fight the oppressors...

295
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,160
for your right to have
babies, brother

296
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,000
Sister. Sorry.
What's the point?

297
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,290
What?
What's the point of fighting
for his right to have babies...

298
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,700
when he can't have babies?

299
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:42,290
It is symbolic of our
struggle against oppression.

300
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,200
Symbolic of his struggle
against reality.

301
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,290
It's dangerous out there.

302
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,290
Larks' tongues. Otters' noses.
Ocelot spleens.

303
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,580
Got any nuts?
Haven't got any nuts. Sorry.

304
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,040
I've got wrens' livers,
badger spleens
No, no, no.

305
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,660
Otters' noses?
I don't want that Roman rubbish!

306
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,950
Why don't you sell proper food?
Proper food?

307
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,750
Yeah, and not those rich,
lmperialist tidbits.

308
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,950
Well, don't blame me.
I didn't ask to sell this stuff.

309
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,120
All right.
Bag of otters' noses, then.

310
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,950
Make it two. Thanks, Reg.
Two.

311
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,790
Are you the Judean People's Front?
Fuck off!

312
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:51,910
What?
Judean People's Front!

313
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,250
We're the People's Front of Judea!

314
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:59,080
Judean People's Front!
Wankers.

315
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,500
Can I join your group?
No. Piss off.

316
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,370
I didn't want to sell
this stuff. It's only a job.

317
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:11,080
I hate the Romans as much as anybody!
Shhh. Shhh!

318
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,580
Are you sure?
Oh, dead sure. I hate the Romans.

319
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,080
Listen, if you wanted
to join the P.F.J.,

320
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,120
you'd have to really
hate the Romans.

321
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,160
I do.
Oh, yeah? How much?

322
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,250
A lot.

323
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,620
Right. You're in.

324
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,660
Listen. The only people
we hate more than the Romans...

325
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,040
are the fuckin'
Judean People's Front.

326
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,700
Yeah!
Splitters!

327
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,700
And the Judean Popular People's Front.
Oh, yeah! Splitters!

328
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:44,450
And the People's Front of Judea.
Splitters!

329
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,620
What?
The People's Front of Judea.
We're the People's Front of Judea!

330
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,700
Oh. I thought we were
the Popular Front.

331
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,120
People's Front!

332
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,290
What happened to the Popular Front?
He's over there.

333
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,750
Splitter!

334
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,540
Oh! I think I'm about
to have a cardiac arrest.

335
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:18,660
Absolutely dreadful.

336
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:34,870
Brother! Haha!
What's your name?

337
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,500
Brian. Brian Cohen.

338
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,870
We may have a little job
for you, Brian.

339
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,160
What's this, then?
"Romanes eunt domus"?

340
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,370
"People called Romanes,
they go the house"?

341
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,620
Ilt says "Romans, go home."

342
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,750
No, it doesn't.
What's Latin for "Roman"?

343
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,910
Come on!
"Romanes"?

344
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Goes like?
"Annus"?

345
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,120
Vocative plural of "annus" is?
"Anni"?
"Romani."

346
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,790
"Eunt"? What is "eunt"?
"Go."

347
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:07,410
Conjugate the verb "to go."
"lre, eo, is, it,
imus, itis, eunt."

348
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,500
So "eunt" is?

349
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,250
Third person plural,
present indicative."They go."

350
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:17,000
But "Romans, go home" is
an order, so you must use the

351
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,410
The imperative.
Which is?
Um, oh, oh, "i."

352
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,000
How many Romans?
Aah! Plural, plural.

353
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,950
"lte."
"lte."

354
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,200
"Domus"? Nominative?

355
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:34,410
"Go home." This is motion
towards, isn't it, Brian?

356
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,410
Dative!

357
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,540
No, not dative!

358
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,040
Accusative, accusative!

359
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,540
"Domum," sir."Ad domum."
Except when "domus" takes the

360
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,580
Locative, sir.
Which is?

361
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,830
"Domum."
"Domum."

362
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:51,080
"Um."

363
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,450
Understand?
Yes, sir.
Now, write it out 100 times.

364
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,000
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Hail Caesar, sir.

365
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,950
Hail Caesar. If it's not done
by sunrise, I'll cut your balls off.

366
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,080
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
Hail Caesar and everything, sir.

367
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,950
Finished!

368
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:31,450
Right. Now,
don't do it again.

369
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,410
Hey, bloody Romans!

370
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:35,790
We're gettin' in through the
underground heating system here,

371
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:41,950
up through into the main
audience chamber here,
and Pilate's wife's bedroom is here.

372
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,500
Having grabbed his wife, we inform
Pilate that she is in our custody...

373
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:50,910
and forthwith issue our demands.
Any questions?
What exactly are the demands?

374
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,160
We're giving Pilate
two days to dismantle...

375
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,750
the entire apparatus of
the Roman lmperialist State,

376
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,160
and if he doesn't agree
immediately, we execute her.

377
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:01,250
Cut her head off?
Cut all her bits off.

378
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:04,290
Send them back
on the hour, every hour.

379
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:07,080
And, of course, we point out
that they bear...

380
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,660
full responsibility
when we chop her up...

381
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,910
and that we shall not submit
to blackmail.

382
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,055
No blackmail!

383
00:28:15,105 --> 00:28:18,580
They bled us white, the bastards.
They've taken everything we had.

384
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,370
And not just from us. From our fathers
and from our fathers' fathers.

385
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,790
And from our fathers' fathers' fathers.
Yeah.

386
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:28,500
And from our fathers'
fathers' fathers' fathers.
Don't labor the point.

387
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,120
And what have they ever
given us in return?

388
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,790
The aqueduct.
What?

389
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,950
The aqueduct.

390
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,660
Oh, yeah, yeah.
They did give us that.
And the sanitation.

391
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,250
Oh, yeah, the sanitation, Reg.
Remember what the city used to be like.

392
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:51,080
Yeah, I'll grant you,
the aqueduct and sanitation are
two things the Romans have done.

393
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,080
And the roads.
Well, obviously the roads.

394
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,700
I mean, the roads go
without saying, don't they?

395
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,700
But apart from the sanitation,
the aqueduct and the roads

396
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,660
lrrigation.
Medicine.

397
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:07,290
Education.
Yeah, all right. Fair enough.
And the wine.

398
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,620
Yeah, that's something we'd really miss,
Reg, if the Romans left.

399
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,500
Public baths.
And it's safe to walk
in the streets at night.

400
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:19,870
Yeah, they certainly keep order.
They're the only ones who could
in a place like this.

401
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,500
All right, but apart from
the sanitation, the medicine,

402
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,700
education, wine, public order,
irrigation, roads,

403
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,330
the fresh water system
and public health,

404
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:32,700
what have the Romans
ever done for us?

405
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:36,700
Brought peace.
Oh, peace! Shut up!

406
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,540
I'm a poor man.
My sight is poor.

407
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,870
My legs are old and bent.

408
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:57,080
It's all right, Matthias.
It's all clear.

409
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,330
Well, where's Reg?

410
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,620
Oh, Reg. Reg, Judith.

411
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,750
What went wrong?
The first blow has been struck.

412
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,000
Did he finish the slogan?
A hundred times,

413
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:22,040
in letters ten foot high,
all the way around the palace.

414
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,870
Oh, great. Great.

415
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,870
We We need doers
in our movement, Brian,

416
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,330
but before you join us, know this:

417
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,040
There is not one of us who
would not gladly suffer death...

418
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,870
to rid this country of
the Romans once and for all.
Oh, yeah, there's one.

419
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:44,040
But otherwise, we're solid.
Are you with us?
Yes.

420
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,870
From now on you shall be called
"Brian that is called Brian."

421
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:51,910
Tell him about the raid
on Pilate's palace, Francis.

422
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,000
Right.
This is the plan.

423
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,620
Now, this is the palace
on Caesar's Square.

424
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,540
Our commando unit will approach
from Fish Street under cover of night...

425
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:04,160
and make our way
to the northwestern main drain.

426
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:08,250
If questioned, we are sewage workers
on our way to a conference.

427
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:11,870
Reg, our glorious leader
and founder of the P.F.J.,

428
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:15,450
will be coordinating consultant
at the drain head,

429
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:20,750
though he himself will not be taking
part in any terrorist action...
as he has a bad back.

430
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:25,830
Aren't you going to come with us?
Solidarity, brother.
Oh, yes, solidarity, Reg.

431
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:29,040
Once in the sewer,
timing will be of the essence.

432
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,290
There is a Roman feast later
in the evening, so you must move fast.

433
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:35,370
And don't wear
your best sandals.

434
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:39,120
Turning left here, we enter the
CaesarAugustus memorial sewer,

435
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,950
and from there proceed
directly to the hypocaust.

436
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:46,870
This has just been retiled. So,
terrorists, careful with those weapons.

437
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:50,660
We will now be directly beneath
Pilate's audience chamber itself.

438
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,290
This is the moment for Habbakuk
to get out his prong.

439
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,040
Shhh. Shhh.

440
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,830
Campaign for Free Galilee.

441
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:19,040
Oh, uh, People's Front
of Judea. Officials.

442
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,790
Oh.
What's your group doing here?

443
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:25,000
We're gonna kidnap Pilate's wife,
take her back, issue demands.

444
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,040
So are we. That's our plan.
What?

445
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,580
We were here first.
What do you mean?

446
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,000
We thought of it first.
We did!

447
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,620
Yes, a couple of years ago.
We did!

448
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,040
Come on. You got all your demands
worked out, then?

449
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,290
Of course we have.
What are they?

450
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,830
Well, I'm not telling you.
Oh, come on!

451
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,660
That's not the point.
We thought of it before you.

452
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,660
Did not!
We did!

453
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,870
You bastards, we've been
planning this for months.

454
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,200
Well, tough pity for you,
Fish Face. Oh!

455
00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:01,700
Brothers, we should
be struggling together.
We mustn't fight each other.

456
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:07,750
Surely, we should be united
against the common enemy.
The Judean People's Front!

457
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,200
No, no, the Romans!

458
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,750
Oh, yeah, yeah.

459
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,370
Yeah, he's right.

460
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,000
Right. Where were we?
You were gonna punch me.

461
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:50,450
Brothers!

462
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,580
What

463
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,870
You lucky bastard.

464
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,950
Who's that?

465
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,370
You lucky, lucky bastard.
What?
Quite the little jailer's pet, are we?

466
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,950
What do you mean?
You must've slipped him a few shekels.

467
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Slipped him a few shekels?
You saw him spit in my face.

468
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,330
Oh, what wouldn't I give
to be spat at in the face!

469
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:17,040
I sometimes hang awake at night
dreaming of being spat at in the face.

470
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:22,500
Well, it's not exactly friendly.
They have me in manacles.
Manacles?

471
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:28,450
My idea of heaven is to be
allowed to be put in manacles...
just for a few hours.

472
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:32,700
They must think the sun shines
out of your ass, son.

473
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,830
Oh, lay off me!
I've had a hard time!

474
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:38,160
You've had a hard time?
I've been here five years.

475
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:44,000
They only hung me the right way
up yesterday, so don't you
All right, all right.

476
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,870
They must think
you're Lord God Almighty.

477
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:51,700
What will they do to me?
Oh, you'll probably
get away with crucifixion.

478
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:54,870
Crucifixion?
Yeah, first offense.

479
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:57,040
Get away with crucifixion?
It's

480
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,950
Best thing the Romans ever did for us.
What?

481
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,450
Oh, yeah, if we didn't have crucifixion,
this country'd be in a bloody mess.

482
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,370
Guard!
Nail him up, I say!

483
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:09,540
Guard!
Nail some sense into him!

484
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,660
What do you want?

485
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,910
I want you to move me to another cell.

486
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,450
Aah!
Oh, look at that! Bloody favoritism.

487
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,450
Shut up, you!
Sorry.

488
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,750
Now take my case.
They hung me up here five years ago.

489
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:30,790
Every night, they take me down for
20 minutes, then they hang me up again,

490
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,910
which I regard as very fair
in view of what I've done.

491
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:38,750
And if nothing else, it's
taught me to respect the Romans,

492
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:42,750
and it's taught me that you'll
never get anywhere in this life...

493
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:47,250
unless you're prepared to do
a fair day's work for a fair day's

494
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,870
Oh, shut up!

495
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Here.
Pilate wants to see you.

496
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Me?
Come on!

497
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,290
Pilate? What's he want
to see me for?

498
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:00,290
I think he wants to know which way up
you want to be crucified.

499
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:03,790
Nice one, centurion. Like it.

500
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:08,160
Shut up!
Right, right.

501
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:12,120
Terrific race, the Romans.
Terrific!

502
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,540
Hail Caesar.
Hail.

503
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:35,370
Only one survivor, sir.
Oh."Thwow" him to the floor.

504
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:38,620
What's that?
Throw him to the floor.

505
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,620
Oh.

506
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,870
Now, what is
your name, Jew?

507
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,870
Brian, sir.
"Bwian," eh?

508
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,830
No, no. Brian.

509
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:54,120
Aah!

510
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,120
The little rascal
has "spiwit."

511
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,540
Has what, sir?
"Spiwit."

512
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,660
Yes, he did, sir.

513
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:06,120
No, no."Spiwit," "bwavado,"
a touch of "dewwingdo."

514
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,700
Oh, uh, about 11, sir.

515
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:14,870
So, you dare to "waid" us?

516
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,910
To what, sir?

517
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:19,410
"Stwike" him, centurion,
very "woughly."

518
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,870
Aah!
And "thwow" him to the floor, sir?

519
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:25,500
What?
"Thwow" him to the floor again, sir?

520
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,580
Oh, yes, "thwow" him
to the floor, please.

521
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:33,540
Aah!
Now, Jewish "wapscallion"

522
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,750
I'm not Jewish.
I'm a Roman.

523
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:38,700
A "Woman"?
No, no. Roman.

524
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,750
Aah!

525
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:45,750
So, your father was
a "Woman." Who was he?

526
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:49,540
He was a centurion
in the Jerusalem garrison, sir.

527
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,830
Really?
What was his name?

528
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:56,200
"Naughtius Maximus."

529
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Centurion, do you have
anyone of that name in the garrison?
Well, no, sir.

530
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,250
Well, you sound very sure.
Have you checked?

531
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:12,120
Well, no, sir.
I think it's a joke, sir.

532
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,330
Like, uh, "Sillius Soddus"
or "Biggus Dickus," sir.

533
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,450
What's funny
about "Biggus Dickus"?

534
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:25,870
Well, it's a joke name, sir.

535
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:29,660
I have a very great
friend in Rome called Biggus Dickus.

536
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,120
Silence!
What is all this insolence?

537
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,620
You will find yourself
in gladiator school "vewy" quickly...

538
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:44,080
with "wotten" behavior like that.
Can I go now, sir?
Aaah!

539
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:50,000
Wait till Biggus Dickus
hears of this.
"Wight"! Take him away!

540
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,700
Oh, sir, he
I want him fighting wild,
"wabid" animals within a week.

541
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:56,620
Yes, sir.
Come on, you.

542
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:05,500
I will not have my friends
"widiculed" by the common "soldiewy."

543
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:11,910
Anyone else feel like
a little giggle...

544
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,580
when I mention my "fwiend,"

545
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,870
Biggus...

546
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:22,040
Dickus?

547
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:29,660
What about you?
Do you find it "wisible"...

548
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:34,500
when I say the name...

549
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:39,200
Biggus... Dickus?

550
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:02,580
He has a wife, you know?

551
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,330
You know what she's called?

552
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:11,160
She's called "lncontinentia."

553
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:16,120
"lncontinentia Buttocks."

554
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,540
Shut up!
What is all this?

555
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,830
I've had enough of this
"wowdy," "webel" behavior!

556
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:25,700
Silence! Quiet!
"Pwaetowian" guards!

557
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:29,580
Seize him! Seize him!
Blow your noses and seize him!

558
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:46,120
Hmm? Hmm.

559
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:30,250
Oh, you lucky bastard.

560
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:49,080
And the bezan
shall be huge and black...

561
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:53,700
And the eyes thereof red with
the blood of living creatures!

562
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:56,620
And the whore of Babylon...

563
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:59,870
shall ride forth
on a threeheaded serpent!

564
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,910
And throughout the lands
there'll be a great rubbing of parts.

565
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,410
The demon shall bear
a ninebladed sword.

566
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:14,000
Ninebladed not two
or five or seven, but nine

567
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:18,790
which he will wield on all wretched
sinners, just like you, sir, there.

568
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:23,040
And the whoring shall be
on the head of Addius.

569
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:28,540
There shall in that time
be rumors of things going astray,

570
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:33,120
um, and there shall be a great confusion
as to where things really are.

571
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,200
And nobody will really know
where lieth...

572
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:38,830
those little things...

573
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:42,120
with the sort of raffia work
base that has an attachment.

574
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:47,000
At this time, a friend
shall lose his friend's hammer,

575
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,870
and the young shall not know
where lieth...

576
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:53,200
the things possessed
by their fathers...

577
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,910
that their fathers put there
only just the night before about 8:00.

578
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,830
Yea, it is written
in the Book of Cyril...

579
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:03,330
in that time

580
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:15,370
How much, quick?
It's for the wife.

581
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:18,450
Oh, uh, 20 shekels.
Right.

582
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,580
What?
There you are.

583
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:22,660
Wait a minute.
What?

584
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,080
We're supposed to haggle.
No, no, no. I've got to get

585
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,040
What do you mean, no?
I haven't got time.

586
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,620
Well, give it back, then.
No, no. I just paid you.

587
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:33,040
Burt, this bloke won't haggle.
Won't haggle?

588
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,290
All right.
Do we have to?

589
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:37,950
I want 20 for that.
I just gave you 20.

590
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,790
Are you telling me
that's not worth 20 shekels?
No.

591
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:44,290
Feel the quality.
That's none of your goat.
I'll give you 19, then.

592
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:46,330
No, no, no. Do it properly.
What?

593
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:49,830
Haggle properly. This isn't worth 19.
You just said it was worth 20.

594
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:52,660
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
Come on, haggle.

595
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:55,200
All right, I'll give you ten.
That's more like it.

596
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:57,410
Ten? Are you
trying to insult me?

597
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,290
Me with a poor, dying
grandmother? Ten?

598
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:03,200
All right, I'll give you 11.
Now you're gettin' it.

599
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:07,700
Did I hear you right? Eleven?
This cost me 12. You want to ruin me?

600
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:10,450
Seventeen?
No, no, no, no. Seventeen.

601
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,000
Eighteen.
No, no. You go to 14 now.

602
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,950
All right, I'll give you 14.
Fourteen? Are you joking?

603
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,290
That's what you told me to say!
Oh, dear.

604
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:20,700
Oh, tell me
what to say, please!

605
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,750
Offer me 14.
I'll give you 14.

606
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:25,870
He's offering me 14 for this!
Fifteen!

607
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:29,290
Seventeen. My last word. I won't take
a penny less, or strike me dead.

608
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:31,200
Sixteen.
Done.

609
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,330
Nice to do business with you.

610
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:36,370
I'll throw you in this as well.
I don't want it, but thanks.

611
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:38,700
Burt.
All right, all right.

612
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:41,540
Now, where's the 16 you owe me?
I just gave you 20.

613
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:44,330
Right. That's four I owe you, then.
That's right. That's fine.

614
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:49,540
I've got it here somewhere.
That's four for the gourd.
Four? For this gourd?

615
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:52,450
Look at it! It's worth ten
if it's worth a shekel.

616
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:57,660
You gave it to me for nothing.
Yes, but it's worth ten.
All right, all right.

617
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,540
No, no, no, no.
It's not worth ten.

618
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:06,540
You're supposed to argue.
"Ten for that? You must be mad."

619
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,410
Oh, well.
One born every minute.

620
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:14,450
Daniel.
Daniel.

621
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:16,700
Job.
Job.

622
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:18,870
Joshua.
Joshua.

623
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:21,250
Judges.
Judges.

624
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:24,000
And Brian.
And Brian.

625
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:28,450
I now propose that all seven
of these exbrothers...

626
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:32,000
be now entered in the minutes
as probationary martyrs to the cause.

627
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,500
I second that, Reg.
Thank you, Loretta. On the nod.

628
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:39,790
Siblings, let us not
be down on it.

629
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:43,250
One total catastrophe like this...

630
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:48,120
is just the beginning!
Their glorious deaths
shall unite us all in

631
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,120
Look out!

632
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:03,000
Hello?

633
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,120
Matthias?

634
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,540
Reg?
Go away.

635
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,200
Reg, it's me, Brian.

636
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:13,370
Get off!
Get off out of it!

637
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,410
Stan!
Piss off.

638
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:17,790
Yeah, piss off.
Bugger off.

639
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:22,500
Oh, shit!

640
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:24,500
Coming.

641
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:32,870
Yea, verily at that time it is
written in the book of Obadiah,

642
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:37,870
a man shall strike his donkey
and his nephew's donkey.

643
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:44,080
My eyes are dim.
I cannot see.

644
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,580
Are you Matthias?
Yes.

645
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,620
We have reason to believe
you may be hiding one Brian of Nazareth,

646
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,870
a member of the terrorist organization,
the People's Front of Judea.

647
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:55,660
Me? No.
I'm just a poor old man.

648
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:57,790
I have no time
for lawbreakers.

649
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:02,250
My legs are grey.
My ears are nulled.
My eyes are old and bent.

650
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:04,410
Quiet!
Silly person.

651
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,620
Guards, search the house.

652
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,620
You know the penalty
laid down by Roman law...

653
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,660
for harboring
a known criminal?

654
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:23,700
No.
Crucifixion.

655
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:26,000
Oh.

656
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,750
Nasty, eh?
Could be worse.

657
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:34,540
What do you mean,
"Could be worse"?
Well, you could be stabbed.

658
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:38,080
Stabbed? Takes a second.
Crucifixion lasts hours.

659
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,750
It's a slow, horrible death.

660
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:44,080
Well, at least it gets you
out in the open air.

661
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:47,200
You're weird.

662
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,790
No, sir.
Couldn't find anything, sir.

663
00:50:57,870 --> 00:51:02,120
Well, don't worry.
You've not seen the last of us, weirdo.

664
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,660
Big Nose.
Watch it!

665
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:10,080
Whew, that was lucky.

666
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:15,200
I'm sorry, Reg.

667
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:17,540
Oh, it's all right.
He's sorry.

668
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:20,330
He's sorry he led the Fifth Legion
straight to our headquarters.

669
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:23,250
Well, that's all right,
then, Brian. Sit down.

670
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,870
Have a scone.
Make yourself at home. You klutz!

671
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:30,410
You stupid, birdbrained,
flatheaded

672
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:41,200
My legs are old and bent.

673
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:46,410
My ears are grizzled. Yes?
There's one place
we didn't look. Guards!

674
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:50,620
I'm just a poor old man.

675
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,620
My nose is knackered.

676
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:57,540
Have you ever seen
anyone crucified?
Crucifixion's a doddle.

677
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,580
Don't keep saying that.

678
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:06,660
Found this spoon, sir.

679
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,910
Well done, sergeant.

680
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,540
We'll be back, oddball.

681
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:17,080
Open up!

682
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,700
You haven't given us
time to hide.

683
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:35,580
ln that time
The serpent, he shall strike you

684
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:40,120
Holes from every bitch
you got germs from
Jumbo jets

685
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:47,080
Don't pass judgement
on other people...

686
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,250
or you might
get judged yourself.

687
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:53,000
What?
I said, don't pass
judgement on other people...

688
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,750
or else you might
get judged too.

689
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:57,750
Who, me?
Yes.

690
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:00,910
Thank you very much.
Not just you. All of you.

691
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,370
That's a nice gourd.
What?

692
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:05,910
How much do you want for the gourd?
You can have it.

693
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,750
Have it?
Yes. Consider the lilies.

694
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:11,040
Don't you want to haggle?
No. In the field.

695
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,330
What's wrong with it?
Nothing. Take it.

696
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:16,620
Consider the lilies?
Well, the birds, then.

697
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,580
What birds?
Any birds.

698
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:21,200
Why?
Well, have they got jobs?

699
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:23,200
Who?
The birds.

700
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:28,790
Have the birds got jobs?
What's the matter with him?
Says the birds are scrounging.

701
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:31,790
The point is, the birds,
they do all right, don't they?

702
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:34,700
Well, good luck to 'em.
Yeah, they're very pretty.

703
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:38,750
Okay. And you're much more
important than they are, right?

704
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:41,580
So what are you worrying about?
There you are. See?

705
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:44,290
I'm worrying about what
you've got against birds.

706
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:46,450
I haven't got anything
against the birds.

707
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:49,500
Consider the lilies.
He's having a go at the flowers now!

708
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:52,500
Give the flowers a chance.
I'll give you one for it.

709
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:54,790
It's yours.
Two, then.

710
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:57,120
Look, there was this man,
and he had two servants.

711
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,950
What were they called?
What were their names?

712
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,500
I don't know.
And he gave them some talents.

713
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,330
You don't know?
Well, it doesn't matter.

714
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:07,410
He doesn't know
what they were called!

715
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:10,790
They were called Simon and Adrian.
You said you didn't know!

716
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:13,910
It really doesn't matter. The point is,
there were these two servants.

717
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:16,910
He's making it up as he goes along.
No, I'm not!

718
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,700
And he gave them
Wait, were there three?
Oh, he's terrible.

719
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:25,250
There were two or three.
Oh, get off!

720
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,830
Now hear this!
Blessed are they...

721
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:36,200
Three.
who convert their neighbor's asses.

722
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:40,040
For they shall inhibit their girth.
Rubbish!

723
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:43,330
And to them only shall be given

724
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:46,700
to them only...

725
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:50,580
shall be given

726
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:54,370
What?
Hmm?

727
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:57,080
Shall be given what?
Oh, nothing.

728
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,540
What were you going to say?
Nothing.

729
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,870
Yes, you were going to say something.
No, I finished.

730
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,080
Tell us before you go.
I'm finished.

731
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,450
No, you don't.
Why won't he tell?

732
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:10,200
Won't say!
It ain't a secret, is it?

733
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:13,080
Must be, otherwise he'd tell us.
Tell us.

734
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,160
Leave me alone.
What is the secret?

735
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:17,620
ls it the secret of eternal life?
He won't say.

736
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:20,450
If I knew the secret
of eternal life, I wouldn't say.

737
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:26,000
Leave me alone!
Just tell me, please.
We were here first.

738
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,660
Go away!
Tell us, master.

739
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:33,910
ls that his gourd?
Yeah, but it's under offer.
This is his gourd.

740
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,200
Ten!
It is his gourd!

741
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:40,250
We will carry it
for you, master.

742
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:43,790
Master?
He's gone!

743
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:46,290
He's been taken up.

744
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:48,410
He's been taken up!

745
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,450
Nineteen!
No, there he is. Over there.

746
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:19,910
Look! Oh! Oh!

747
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
He has given us a sign.

748
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,370
He has given us his shoe!

749
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:27,250
The shoe is the sign.
Let us follow his example.

750
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:31,500
What?
Let us, like him, hold up one shoe!

751
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:35,790
For this is his sign that all
who follow him shall do likewise!

752
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:38,410
Yes!
No, no. The shoe is a sign...

753
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:41,620
that we must gather shoes
together in abundance.

754
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,200
Cast off the shoes.
Follow the gourd!

755
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:47,370
No, let us gather shoes
together! Let me!

756
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:51,750
No, it is a sign that, like him, we must
think not of the things of the body...

757
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:56,410
but of the face and head.
Give me your shoe!
Get off!

758
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:59,950
Follow the gourd,
the Holy Gourd of Jerusalem!

759
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:03,700
The gourd!
Hold up the sandal,
as he has commanded us.

760
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:06,370
It is a shoe!
It's a sandal!

761
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,950
No, it isn't!
Cast it away!

762
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,910
Put it on!
Clear off!

763
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,620
Take the shoes
and follow him!

764
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:22,250
Come back! Stop!

765
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:25,750
Let us Let us pray.

766
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:29,830
Yea, he cometh to us...

767
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:32,200
Iike the seeds of the grain.

768
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:58,250
Master! Master!

769
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,200
Hey! ls there
another way down?

770
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:26,910
Is there another path
down to the river?

771
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,330
Please, please help me.
I've got to get

772
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:36,950
Oh, my foot! Oh

773
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,370
Shhh.
Oh, damn, damn, damn!

774
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:44,000
I'm sorry.
Oh, damn, damn it! Blast it!

775
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,290
I'm sorry. Shhh.
Don't you "shhh" me.

776
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:49,450
Eighteen years of total silence,
and you "shhh" me!

777
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:52,660
What?
I've kept my vow for 18 years...

778
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:56,790
Not a single, recognizable,
articulate sound has passed my lips.

779
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:59,410
Could you be quiet
for another five minutes?

780
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,120
It doesn't matter now.
I might as well enjoy myself.

781
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,950
For the last 18 years,
I've wanted to shout...

782
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,750
and sing and scream
my name out!

783
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:13,120
Shhh. Shhh.
Oh, I'm alive!
" Hava nagila, hava nagila "

784
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,040
" Hava nagila "

785
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:19,700
Oh, I'm alive! I'm alive!
Hello, birds. Hello, trees.

786
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:22,540
I'm alive! I'm alive!

787
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:27,540
" Hava nagila
Hava n'ra, n'ra "

788
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:31,120
Master! Master! Master!

789
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,660
Master!
The master! He is here!

790
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:39,160
His shoe led us to him!

791
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:42,910
Speak! Speak to us, master.
Speak to us!

792
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:44,660
Go away!

793
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:47,370
A blessing! A blessing!

794
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:49,870
How shall we go away, master?

795
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:54,620
Oh, just go away
and leave me alone!
Give us a sign!

796
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:58,000
He has given us a sign!
He has brought us to this place!

797
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,910
I didn't bring you here.
You just followed me.

798
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:04,000
Oh, it's still a good sign
by any standard.

799
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:07,040
Master, your people
have walked many miles to be with you!

800
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,080
They are weary
and have not eaten.

801
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,290
It's not my fault
they haven't eaten.

802
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:13,830
There is no food
in this high mountain!

803
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:17,120
What about the juniper
bushes over there?

804
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:20,910
A miracle! A miracle!

805
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,330
He has made the bush
fruitful by his words!

806
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:27,830
They've brought forth
juniper berries.

807
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:33,700
Of course! They're juniper bushes!
What do you expect!
Show us another miracle.

808
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:39,700
Do not tempt him, shallow ones!
Is not the miracle of
the juniper bushes enough?

809
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:41,870
I say, those
are my juniper bushes!

810
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:45,700
They are a gift from God.
They're all I've got to eat.

811
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:50,870
I say, get off those bushes.
Go on. Clear off.

812
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:55,250
Lord, I am affected
by a bald patch.

813
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:58,660
I'm healed!
The master has healed me!

814
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,620
I didn't touch him!

815
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:03,540
I was blind,
and now I can see!

816
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:06,700
A miracle! A miracle!

817
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:09,870
Tell them to stop it.

818
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:13,540
I hadn't said a word
for 18 years till he came along.

819
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:17,290
A miracle!
He is the Messiah!

820
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:19,080
He hurt my foot!

821
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,450
Hurt my foot!
Hurt mine!

822
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:26,290
Hail Messiah!
I'm not the Messiah.

823
01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:32,290
I say you are, Lord, and I should know.
I've followed a few.
Hail Messiah!

824
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:35,250
I'm not the Messiah!
Will you please listen?

825
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:38,580
I'm not the Messiah!
Do you understand? Honestly!

826
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:43,040
Only the true Messiah
denies his divinity.

827
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:46,450
What? Well, what sort of chance
does that give me?

828
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:48,790
All right,
I am the Messiah!

829
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:52,540
He is!
He is the Messiah!

830
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:55,000
Now, fuck off!

831
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:06,700
How shall we
fuck off, O Lord?
Just leave me alone!

832
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:09,870
You told these people
to eat my juniper berries!

833
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:12,950
You break my bloody foot,
you break my vow of silence...

834
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:16,120
and then you try to clean up
on my juniper bushes!

835
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:19,540
Lay off!
This is the Messiah, the Chosen One!

836
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:22,660
No, he's not.
An unbeliever!

837
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:26,950
An unbeliever!
Persecute. Kill the heretic!

838
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,910
Seize him!
Leave him alone!

839
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,330
Leave him alone!

840
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:37,660
Leave him alone.

841
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:40,700
Let him go! Please!

842
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:47,580
Brian?
Judith?

843
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:55,290
Cockadoodledoo!

844
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:39,080
Look! There he is!
The Chosen One has woken!

845
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:44,000
Brian!

846
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:50,700
Brian!
Hang on, Mother!
Shhh.

847
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:55,790
Hello, Mother.
Don't you "Hello, Mother" me!

848
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:58,040
What are all those people
doing out there?

849
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:01,080
Well, I
Come on. What have you been up to?

850
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:03,620
I think they must have
popped by for something.

851
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:06,450
Popped by?
Swarmed by, more like.

852
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:10,830
There's a multitude out there!
They started following me yesterday.

853
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:14,040
Well, they can stop
following you right now.

854
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,000
Now, stop following my son!

855
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,950
You ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.

856
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:24,370
The Messiah! The Messiah!
Show us the Messiah!

857
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:27,330
The who?
The Messiah!

858
01:04:27,370 --> 01:04:30,040
There's no messiah in here.

859
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:35,950
There's a mess, all right,
but no messiah. Now, go away.
Brian! Brian!

860
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,160
Right, my lad.
What have you been up to?

861
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,160
Nothing, Mum.
Come on, out with it.

862
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:42,200
Well, they think
I'm the Messiah, Mum.

863
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:44,620
What have you
been telling them?

864
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:47,040
Nothing. I only
You're only making it
worse for yourself.

865
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:50,580
I can explain.
Let me explain, Mrs. Cohen!

866
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:53,330
Your son is a born leader.

867
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:57,040
Those people out there are following him
because they believe in him.

868
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:00,040
They believe he can give them hope
hope of a new life,

869
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,620
a new world,
a better future!

870
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:07,080
Who's that?

871
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:10,160
That's Judith, Mum.
Judith, Mother.

872
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:12,200
Hmm. Aaah!

873
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:18,040
Ohhh!
Messiah! Messiah! Messiah!

874
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:21,080
Messiah!
Show us the Messiah!

875
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,410
Now, you listen here.
He's not the Messiah!

876
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:27,700
He's a very naughty boy.
Now, go away!

877
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:31,830
Who are you?
I'm his mother, that's who.

878
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:36,410
Behold his mother!
Behold his mother!

879
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,910
Hail to thee,
mother of Brian!

880
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:44,500
Blessed art thou!
Hosanna!

881
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:48,200
All praise to thee,
now and always!

882
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:51,500
Well, now don't think
you can get around me like that.

883
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:55,040
He's not coming out,
and that's my final word.

884
01:05:56,330 --> 01:05:59,200
Now, shove off!
No!

885
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:03,700
Did you hear what I said?
Yes!

886
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:06,700
Oh, I see.
It's like that, is it?

887
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:10,200
Yes!
Oh, all right, then.

888
01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:14,035
You can see him for one minute,
but not one second more!

889
01:06:14,085 --> 01:06:16,500
Do you understand?
Yes.

890
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:20,790
Promise?
Well... all right.

891
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:24,540
All right, here he is, then.
Come on, Brian. Come and talk.

892
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:30,040
But, Mum, Judith.
Oh, leave that Welsh tart alone.
I don't really want to.

893
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:33,160
Brian! Brian!
Brian! Brian!

894
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:40,450
Good morning.
A blessing! A blessing!

895
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:45,080
No, no. Please.
Please, please listen.

896
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,450
I've got one or two
things to say.

897
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:51,120
Tell us!
Tell us both of them!

898
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,950
Look, you've
got it all wrong.

899
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,620
You don't need to follow me.

900
01:06:56,700 --> 01:07:00,000
You don't need
to follow anybody.

901
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:05,200
You've got to think
for yourselves.
You're all individuals.

902
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:08,540
Yes, we're all individuals!

903
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:10,620
You're all different.

904
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:13,870
Yes, we're all different!

905
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,660
I'm not.
Shhh.

906
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:20,370
You've all got to work it
out for yourselves.

907
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:24,580
Yes, we've got to work it
out for ourselves!

908
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,660
Exactly.

909
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:29,000
Tell us more!

910
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:33,580
No! That's the point!
Don't let anyone tell you what to do!

911
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:35,660
Otherwise Ow!

912
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:41,370
That's enough.
That's enough.
Ooh, that wasn't a minute!

913
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:47,200
Oh, yes it was!
Oh, no it wasn't!

914
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:50,200
Now, stop that!
And go away!

915
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:52,540
Excuse me?
Yes?

916
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:56,870
Are you a virgin?
I beg your pardon!

917
01:07:56,950 --> 01:08:01,370
Well, if it's not a personal
question, are you a virgin?

918
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:04,160
If it's not
a personal question?

919
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:09,080
How much more personal
can you get?
Now, piss off!

920
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:12,540
She is.
Yeah, definitely.

921
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:19,830
Morning, Savior.

922
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,830
Lay your hands
on me, quick!

923
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:35,120
Now, don't jostle
the Chosen One, please.

924
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:39,250
Don't push that baby
in the Savior's face.

925
01:08:39,330 --> 01:08:42,950
I say, could you just
see my wife?

926
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,040
You'll have to wait,
I'm afraid.

927
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:49,660
We've got
a luncheon appointment.
The lepers are queuing.

928
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:52,660
My brotheronlaw
is the exmayor of Gath!

929
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:56,830
Brian, can I introduce
the gentleman who's letting us
have the Mounts on Sunday?

930
01:08:56,950 --> 01:09:02,080
Don't push!
And keep the noise down!

931
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:07,250
Those possessed by devils,
try and keep them under control.

932
01:09:07,290 --> 01:09:10,120
Incurables, you'll just
have to wait for a few minutes.

933
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:14,660
Um, women taken in sin, line up
against that wall, will you?

934
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:19,330
Brian? Brian,
you were fantastic.

935
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:24,580
You weren't so bad yourself.
No. What you said just now.
It was quite extraordinary.

936
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,620
What?
All that, was it?

937
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:28,790
We don't need any leaders.
You're so right.

938
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:31,620
Reg has been dominating us
for too long.
Well, yes.

939
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:35,500
It needed saying,
and you said it, Brian.
You're very attractive.

940
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:38,830
It's our revolution.
We can all do it together.

941
01:09:38,910 --> 01:09:41,750
I think. I think
We're all behind you, Brian.

942
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:44,950
The revolution is in your hands!
What?

943
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:47,250
No, that's not
what I meant at all!

944
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:50,660
You're fuckin' nicked,
me old beauty.

945
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:52,660
Right.

946
01:09:58,370 --> 01:10:00,700
Stop it.

947
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:07,160
Well, "Bwian," you've given us
a good "wun" for our money, what?

948
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:12,200
But this time, I "guawantee"
you will not escape.

949
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:17,250
Guard, do we have any
"cwucifixions" today?

950
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:20,950
139, sir. Special celebration.
Passover, sir.

951
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,290
Right. Now we have 140.
Nice, round number, eh, Biggus?

952
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:29,120
Hail Caesar!

953
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:32,200
Hail.
The crowd outside getting restless.

954
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:34,330
Permission
to disperse them, please.

955
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:37,830
Disperse them?
I haven't addressed them yet.

956
01:10:37,950 --> 01:10:39,575
I know, sir, but

957
01:10:39,625 --> 01:10:42,000
My "addwess" is one of
the high points of the Passover.

958
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,330
My "fwiend" Biggus Dickus has
come all the way from "Wome."

959
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:47,870
Hail Caesar.
Hail "Thaesar,"

960
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,750
You're not

961
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:56,660
Are you not thinking of giving it
a miss this year, then, sir?
Give it a miss?

962
01:10:56,700 --> 01:11:00,120
Well, it's just that they're in
a rather funny mood today, sir.

963
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:03,200
"Weally," "centuwion," I'm "surpwised"
to hear a man like you...

964
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:05,750
"wattled" by
a "wabble" of "wowdy" "webels."

965
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:08,870
Uh, a bit thundery, sir.
Take him away.

966
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:11,790
I'm a Roman!
Il can prove it! Honestly!

967
01:11:11,870 --> 01:11:15,200
And "cwucify" him well.
Yes.

968
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,790
Biggus.

969
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:20,620
Il really wouldn't, sir.
Out of the way, "centuwion."

970
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,950
Let me come with you,
Pontius.

971
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:27,200
I may be of "thome" "athistance"
if there is a "thudden" "crithis."

972
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:31,620
Right. Now item four:
Attainment of world supremacy
within the next five years.

973
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:34,870
Uh, Francis, you've been
doing some work on this?
Yeah. Thank you, Reg.

974
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,450
Well, quite frankly, siblings,
I think five years is optimistic...

975
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:41,450
unless we can smash the Roman Empire
within the next 12 months.

976
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,410
Twelve months, yeah?
Twelve months.

977
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:47,000
And let's face it, as empires
go, this is the big one,

978
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:51,290
so we gotta get up off our asses
and stop just talkin' about it.

979
01:11:51,370 --> 01:11:54,250
Hear! Hear!
It's action that counts, not words.

980
01:11:54,370 --> 01:11:56,750
And we need action now!
Hear! Hear!

981
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:58,830
You're right. We could
sit around here all day,

982
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:02,330
talkin', passin' resolutions,
makin' clever speeches.

983
01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:04,750
It's not gonna shift
one Roman soldier!

984
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:08,250
So let's just stop gabbin' on about it.
It's completely pointless.

985
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,290
And it's gettin' us nowhere.
Right!

986
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:13,370
I agree. This is a complete
waste of time.

987
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:16,660
They've arrested Brian!
What? What?

988
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:19,410
They dragged him off!
They want to crucify him!

989
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:23,040
Right! This calls
for immediate discussion!

990
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,620
What?
lmmediate!

991
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:26,160
Right.
New motion?

992
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,540
Completely new motion.
Uh, that, uh,

993
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:31,330
that there be
immediate action

994
01:12:31,370 --> 01:12:34,000
Once the vote has been taken.
Obviously once the vote's been taken.

995
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:38,250
You can't act on a resolution
till you've voted on it.
Reg, let's go now, please!

996
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:43,410
Right! ln the light of fresh
information from Sibling Judith.
Not so fast, Reg.

997
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:47,290
Reg, for God's sake!
It's perfectly simple.

998
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:50,410
All you've got to do
is to go out of that door now...

999
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:53,080
and try to stop the Romans
nailing him up!

1000
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:57,000
It's happening, Reg!
Something's actually happening, Reg!

1001
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,620
Can't you understand?

1002
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,700
Oh!

1003
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:06,370
Ooh. Ooh. Yup.

1004
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,830
A little ego trip
from the feminists?

1005
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:11,410
What?
Oh, sorry, Loretta?

1006
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:13,910
Uh, read that back,
would you?

1007
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:29,250
Next? Crucifixion?

1008
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:31,250
Yes.
Good.

1009
01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:34,910
Out of the door,
line on the left, one cross each.

1010
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:37,040
Next? Crucifixion?

1011
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,080
Yes.
Good.

1012
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:44,160
Out of the door,
line on the left, one cross each.
Next? Crucifixion?

1013
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:46,830
Uh, no, freedom.
Mmm? What?

1014
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:49,370
Uh, freedom for me.
They said I hadn't done anything,

1015
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:52,290
so I could go free
and live on an island somewhere.

1016
01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:55,580
Oh. Well, that's jolly good.
Well, off you go then.

1017
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:58,290
No, I'm only pulling your leg.
It's crucifixion, really.

1018
01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:00,870
Oh, I see.
Very good, very good.

1019
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:03,160
Well, out of the door
Yeah, I know the way. Out the door,

1020
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:07,160
one cross each,
line on the left.
Line on the left. Yes, thank you.

1021
01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:09,450
Crucifixion? Good.
Yes.

1022
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:27,910
People of "Jewusalem,"

1023
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,080
"Wome" is your "fwiend."

1024
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:40,120
To "pwove" our "fwiendship,"
it is "customawy" at this time...

1025
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:43,450
to "welease" a "wandewer"
"fwom" our "pwisons."

1026
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:52,620
Whom would you
have me "welease"?

1027
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:55,790
"Welease" "Woger"!

1028
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:58,660
"Welease" "Woger"!
"Welease" "Woger"!

1029
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:07,290
"Vewy" well,
I shall "welease" "Woger"!

1030
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,700
Sir, uh, we don't
have a Roger, sir.

1031
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:15,200
What?
Uh, we don't have anyone
of that name, sir.

1032
01:15:15,290 --> 01:15:19,580
Ah. We have no "Woger."

1033
01:15:22,410 --> 01:15:24,330
Well, what about
"Wodewick," then?

1034
01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:28,870
Yeah! Release "Wodewick"!
Release "Wodewick"!

1035
01:15:28,910 --> 01:15:33,790
"Centuwion,"
why do they titter so?

1036
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,700
Just some,
uh, Jewish joke, sir.

1037
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:42,200
Are they..."wagging" me?

1038
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:47,290
Oh, no, sir.

1039
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:51,790
"Vewy" well.
I shall "welease" "Wodewick"!

1040
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:57,160
Sir, we don't have a Roderick, either.
No "Woger," no "Wodewick."
Sorry, sir.

1041
01:15:57,250 --> 01:16:02,120
Who is this "Wog" Who is
this "Wodewick" to whom you "wefer"?

1042
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:05,040
He's a "wobber"!

1043
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:08,040
And a "wapist"!

1044
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,160
And a pickpocket!

1045
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:12,580
Yeah Shh! Shh!
Shut up!

1046
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:17,330
He sounds a "notowious" "cwiminal."
We haven't got him, sir.

1047
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:20,160
Do we have anyone
in our "pwisons" at all?

1048
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:23,160
Oh, yes, sir. We got a Samson, sir.
Samson?

1049
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:27,500
Samson the Sadducee Strangler, sir.
Uh, Silus the Assyrian Assassin.

1050
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:30,700
Uh, several seditious scribes
from Caesarea.

1051
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:34,370
Uh, 67
Let me "thpeak" to them.

1052
01:16:34,410 --> 01:16:36,750
Oh, no
Yes, good idea, Biggus.

1053
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:41,450
Citizens, we have
Samson the Sadducee Strangler,

1054
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:44,250
Silus the Assyrian Assassin

1055
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:47,830
Several seditious scribes
from Caesarea.

1056
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:49,910
Next.

1057
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,410
Crucifixion?
Yes.

1058
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:56,200
Good. Out of the door,
line on the left, one cross each.

1059
01:16:56,330 --> 01:16:58,700
Jailer
Excuse me. There's been
some sort of mistake.

1060
01:16:58,790 --> 01:17:04,620
Just a moment, would you?
Jailer, how many have come through?
What?

1061
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:07,750
Uh, how many

ninetysix, sir.

1070
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:44,160
It's such a senseless waste
of human life, isn't it?
NNNNo, sir.

1071
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:48,830
NNot with these bbastards, sir.

1075
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:04,330
I don't think you can say it's
too good for them. It's very nasty.
Oh, it's not as nnnana

1076
01:18:04,330 --> 01:18:07,620
not as nasty as something
I just thought up, sir.

1077
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:11,660
Yeah. Now, crucifixion?
ls there someone I can speak to?

1078
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:15,250
Well
I know where to get it, if you want it.

1079
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:17,830

01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:29,620
BBloody Pilate's pet, sir.

1083
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:33,040
Get a move on, Big Nose. There's people
waitin' to be crucified out here.

1084
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:38,250
Could I see a lawyer or someone?
Um, do, do you have a lawyer?
No, but I'm a Roman.

1085
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:41,200
How about a retrial?
We got plenty of time.

1086
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:46,700
Shut up, you!
Miserable Romans. No sense of humor.
I'm sorry. Bit of a hurry.

1087
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:51,160
Can you go straight out?
Line on the left, one cross each. Now

1088
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:02,370
Was it something I said?

1089
01:19:02,410 --> 01:19:05,540
Silence!

1090
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:11,790
This man commands
a "cwack" legion!

1091
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,910
He "wanks" as high
as any in "Wome."

1092
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:26,450
Crucifixion party.

1093
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,160
Morning. Now, we will be on
a show as we go through the town,

1094
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:34,200
so let's not
let the side down.

1095
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:37,330
Keep in a straight line, three lengths
between you and the man in front...

1096
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:39,660
and a good, steady pace.

1097
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:41,950
Crosses over
your left shoulders,

1098
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:46,620
and if you keep your backs
hard up against the cross beam,
you'll be there in no time.

1099
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:48,660
All right, centurion.

1100
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:52,950
Crucifixion party
Wait for it!

1101
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:58,950
Crucifixion party,
by the left, forward!

1102
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:05,620
You lucky bastards!

1103
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:10,790
You lucky, jammy bastards!

1104
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:23,700
Let me shoulder
your burden, brother.
Oh, thank you.

1105
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:28,540
HHey! Hey!
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

1106
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:32,120
Uh, it's not my cross.
Shut up and get on with it!

1107
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:39,000
He had you there, mate, didn't he?
That'll teach you a lesson.

1108
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:41,870
All right.

1109
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:44,160
I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

1110
01:20:44,290 --> 01:20:47,330
This time I want to hear
no "Weubens,"

1111
01:20:47,410 --> 01:20:50,620
no "Weginalds,"

1112
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:54,080
no "Wudolph
the Wednosed Weindeers."

1113
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:58,120
No Spencer Tracys!
Or we shall release no one!

1114
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:01,500
Release Brian!
Oh, yeah. That's a good one.

1115
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:06,410
"Welease" "Bwian"!
"Welease" "Bwian"!

1116
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:09,250
"Vewy" well. That's it.

1117
01:21:09,290 --> 01:21:12,000
Sir, we, uh, we have got a Brian, sir.
What?

1118
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,160
Uh, you just sent him
for crucifixion, sir.

1119
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:17,200
Wait, wait.
We do have a "Bwian."

1120
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:21,620
Well, go and "wepwieve" him,
"stwaight" away.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1121
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,120
"Vewy" well.

1122
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:28,870
I shall..."welease" "Bwian"!

1123
01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:35,250
Get a move on, there!
Or what?

1124
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:38,000
Or you'll be in trouble.
Oh, dear.

1125
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,120
You mean I might have to give up
being crucified in the afternoons?

1126
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,700
Shut up!
That would be a blow, wouldn't it?

1127
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:47,200
I wouldn't have nothing to do.
Oh, thank you.

1128
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:53,450
Are they gone?

1129
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:57,700
WWe've got lumps of it
round the back.

1130
01:21:57,830 --> 01:22:00,750
What?
Oh, don't worry about him, sir.

1131
01:22:00,830 --> 01:22:03,580
He's ma

1133
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:09,620
He's mad, sir.
Are they gone?

1134
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:12,910
Oh, ye N

Oh, come on!

1137
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:23,290
Yes, sir.

1138
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:27,160
Anyway, get on with the story.
Well, I knew she never
really liked him, so I just

1139
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:28,790
Right.

1140
01:22:28,830 --> 01:22:31,120
That's the motion to get on with it,
passed with one abstention.

1141
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:33,830
I propose we go without further ado.
May I have a seconder for

1142
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:36,000
Let's just go.
Yeah.

1143
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:49,500
Oh, no!

1144
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:54,200
Bloody Romans!
Watch it!

1145
01:22:54,330 --> 01:22:56,870
There's still
a few crosses left.

1146
01:22:57,910 --> 01:23:00,450
Up you go, Big Nose.

1147
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:03,450
I'll get you for this, you bastard.
Oh, yeah?

1148
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:06,830
Oh, yeah. Don't worry.
I never forget a face.
No?

1149
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:11,200
I warn you, I'm gonna punch you
so hard, you Roman git!

1150
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:13,500
Shut up, you Jewish turd!

1151
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:16,790
Who are you calling Jewish?
I'm not Jewish!

1152
01:23:16,830 --> 01:23:19,000
I'm a Samaritan!
A Samaritan?

1153
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:20,870
This is supposed
to be a Jewish section.

1154
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:24,830
It doesn't matter.
You're all gonna die in a day or two!

1155
01:23:24,910 --> 01:23:28,410
It may not matter to you, Roman,
but it certainly matters to us,
doesn't it, darling?

1156
01:23:28,450 --> 01:23:32,080
Oh, rather!
Under the terms
of the Roman occupancy,

1157
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:35,120
we're entitled to be crucified
in a purely Jewish area.

1158
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:37,830
Pharisees separate
from Sadducees.

1159
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:40,950
And Swedish separate from Welsh!

1160
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:44,950
All right, all right, all right.
We'll soon settle this.

1161
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:49,540
Hands up all those who don't
want to be crucified here.

1162
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:52,660
Right. Next!

1163
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:55,700
Uh, look. It's not my cross.
What?

1164
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:58,540
Um, it's not my cross.
I was, um, holding it for someone.

1165
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:00,580
Just lie down.
I haven't got all day.

1166
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:03,000
No, of course. Look.
I hate to make a fuss

1167
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:06,370
Look. We've had a busy day.
There's 140 of you lot to get up.

1168
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:09,000
ls he Jewish?
Will you be quiet?

1169
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:11,330
We don't want any more
Samaritans around here.

1170
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:14,660
Belt up!
Will you let me down if he comes back?

1171
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:17,370
Yeah, yeah,
we'll let you down. Next!

1172
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:22,580
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to take orders.
I like orders.

1173
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,540
See? Not so bad,
once you're up.

1174
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,950
You being rescued, then,
are you?

1175
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:51,950
It's a bit late for that now,
isn't it?

1176
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,410
Oh, now, now. We've got
a couple of days up here.

1177
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:56,450
Plenty of time.
Lots of people get rescued.

1178
01:24:56,540 --> 01:25:00,040
Oh?
Yeah. My brother usually rescues me,

1179
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:02,660
if he can keep off the tail
for more than 20 minutes.

1180
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:07,040
Oh?
Randy little bugger.
Up and down like the Assyrian Empire.

1181
01:25:11,330 --> 01:25:15,450
Hello.
Your family arrived, then?
Reg!

1182
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:19,000
Hello, Sibling Brian.
Thank God you've come, Reg.

1183
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,620
Well, I think I should point out
first, Brian, in all fairness,
we are not the rescue committee.

1184
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:26,540
However, I have been asked to read
the following prepared statement...

1185
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:28,620
on behalf of the movement.

1186
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:32,290
"We the People's Front of Judea

1189
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:42,330
What?
"Your death will stand as a landmark...

on a personal note, my own admiration...

1197
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,950
for what you're doing
for us, Brian,

1198

Well done, Brian.
Keep it up, lad.
Terrific work, Brian.

1201
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:28,870
Right. And

You sanctimonious bastards!
Where is Brian of Nazareth?

1208
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:54,500
I have an order for his release.
You stupid bastards!

1209
01:26:54,620 --> 01:26:56,910
Uh, I'm Brian of Nazareth.
What?

01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,950
Yeah, Ill'm Brian of Nazareth.
Take him down.

1215
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:13,750
Take him away
and release him.

1216
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:18,750
No, I'm only joking. I'm not
really Brian. No, I'm not Brian.

I'm only pulling your leg.

I'm just having you on! Put me back!

Terrific! Great!

1230

Reg has explained it all to me.
I think it's great, what you're doing.
Thank you, Brian.

1231
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:46,790
I'll, I'll never forget you.

1232

So there you are!

1233
01:28:57,910 --> 01:29:00,330
I might have known
it would end up like this.

1234
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:04,370
To think of all the love and
affection I've wasted on you.

1235
01:29:04,450 --> 01:29:07,540
Well, if that's how you treat
your poor old mother...

of her life,

all I can say is,
go ahead, be crucified!

1238
01:29:13,330 --> 01:29:15,870
See if I care.
I might have known

1239
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:18,200
Mum!

01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:22,540
Mum!
I don't know
what the world's coming to.

Cheer up, Brian.
You know what they say.

Some things in life are bad.

1243
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,410
They can really make you mad.

1244
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:41,500
Other things just
make you swear and curse.

You go back to nothing.
What have you lost?

Nothing!
