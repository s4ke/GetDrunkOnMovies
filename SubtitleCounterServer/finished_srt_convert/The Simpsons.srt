1
00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:44,643
We come in peace

2
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:47,315
for cats and mice,
Everywhere.

3
00:01:06,944 --> 00:01:08,019
Hey! How you doing?

4
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,076
<i>Good to see you.</i>

5
00:01:09,077 --> 00:01:10,483
<i>Thanks for coming out.</i>

6
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:19,215
Itchy...

7
00:01:19,249 --> 00:01:20,675
Itchy.

8
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,734
Boring!

9
00:02:00,735 --> 00:02:02,881
Dad! We can't see the movie!

10
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:06,862
I can't believe we’re paying to see
something we get on TV for free!

11
00:02:07,057 --> 00:02:10,829
If you ask me everybody in this
theater is a giant sucker!

12
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:13,311
Especially YOU!

13
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:17,275
<i>The Simpsons</i>

14
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:20,838
Movie, On the big screen!

15
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:52,684
Excuse me my hiney is dipping

16
00:03:08,843 --> 00:03:10,860
Alright. Well, thanks
a lot for coming.

17
00:03:10,861 --> 00:03:13,133
We've been playing
for 3 and a half hours.

18
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:17,656
Now we’d like just a minute of your time
to say something about the environment!

19
00:03:19,471 --> 00:03:22,433
- Boo!
- You Suck!

20
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:24,550
- Shout up and play!
- Preachy!

21
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:25,859
We’re not being preachy.

22
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:29,518
But the pollution in your lake
is dissolving our barge.

23
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,341
I thought they touched
on a vital issue.

24
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:35,852
I beg to differ.

25
00:03:40,865 --> 00:03:43,548
Gentlemen, its been an honor
playing with you tonight.

26
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:08,098
For the latest rock band
to die in our town...

27
00:04:08,143 --> 00:04:10,561
Lord hear our prayer.

28
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:12,365
<i>Lord hear our prayer.</i>

29
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:16,622
- I hate being late!
- Well I hate going!

30
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:18,498
Why can't I worship the
lord in my own way?

31
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:20,298
Like praying like hell
on my death bed.

32
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:22,599
Homer they can
hear you inside!

33
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,834
Relax those pious morons are too busy
talking to their phoney baloney god.

34
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,317
How you doing?

35
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:33,505
Peace be with you.
Pray is cheapest.

36
00:04:44,181 --> 00:04:46,346
Now, today I want to try
something a little different.

37
00:04:46,406 --> 00:04:48,996
I’m gonna call on one of you!

38
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:53,034
Now, the word of God dwells
within everyone.

39
00:04:53,068 --> 00:04:54,914
I want you to let that word out!

40
00:04:54,948 --> 00:04:56,243
Let your spirit...

41
00:04:57,937 --> 00:04:58,822
What is it, Ned?

42
00:04:58,823 --> 00:05:01,315
The good lord is telling me to
confess to something.

43
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:03,600
Gay, Gay, Gay, Gay,
Gay, Gay,Gay, Gay.

44
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:06,785
An immodest sense of pride
in our community.

45
00:05:07,152 --> 00:05:08,740
Somebody else?

46
00:05:08,954 --> 00:05:12,206
Let the lord’s light
shine upon you.

47
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:18,471
Feel the spirit.

48
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:20,910
Let it out!

49
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:24,758
Horrible! Horrible things
are going to happen!

50
00:05:25,384 --> 00:05:27,412
And they’re gonna happen to you,
and you, and you,

51
00:05:27,446 --> 00:05:29,177
and you!

52
00:05:29,217 --> 00:05:30,436
Oh Nelly!

53
00:05:34,806 --> 00:05:37,859
People of Springfield, 
heed this warning:

54
00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:39,087
Twisted tail!

55
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:40,782
A thousand eyes!

56
00:05:40,816 --> 00:05:42,844
Trapped forever!

57
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:48,180
Dad, do something!

58
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:50,588
This book doesn’t have
any answers!

59
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,107
Beware! Beware!
Time is short!

60
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,578
"Epa"! "Epa"!

61
00:05:54,602 --> 00:05:56,882
"Epa"!!!

62
00:05:57,302 --> 00:06:00,305
Believe me!
Believe me!!

63
00:06:06,485 --> 00:06:08,083
Thanks for listening.

64
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:16,399
- Ok, Who wants waffles?
- I do! I do! I do!

65
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:17,911
Wait a minute.
What about grandpa?

66
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:19,477
- I want syrup!
- I want strawberry!

67
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:21,268
Something happen to that man.

68
00:06:21,305 --> 00:06:22,937
I’ll tell you what happened
to him.

69
00:06:22,976 --> 00:06:26,164
A certain someone had a
senior moment.

70
00:06:26,212 --> 00:06:28,900
But that’s ok because
we love him.

71
00:06:28,934 --> 00:06:30,932
And we got a free rug
out of it.

72
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,120
What is the point of going to
church every Sunday,

73
00:06:34,153 --> 00:06:37,358
when if someone we love has a
genuine religious experience,


74
00:06:37,392 --> 00:06:39,674
we ignore it.
Right grandpa?

75
00:06:40,793 --> 00:06:44,657
- I want bananas on my waffles!
- I rest my case.

76
00:06:45,636 --> 00:06:47,382
I’m not dropping this.

77
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:54,944
Wait a minute! I'm still in the car!

78
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:56,129
Oh, right.

79
00:07:02,136 --> 00:07:03,836
Take out hornets nest.

80
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,986
Check.

81
00:07:11,293 --> 00:07:12,566
Fix sink hole.

82
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:21,623
Check.

83
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,437
Reshingle roof?!

84
00:07:27,517 --> 00:07:28,602
Steady..

85
00:07:29,857 --> 00:07:31,486
Steady...

86
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:42,166
Why, you little...I’ll teach you to laugh...
at something that's funny!

87
00:07:43,102 --> 00:07:45,746
You know we are on the roof.
We could have some fun.

88
00:07:46,321 --> 00:07:47,955
What kind of fun?

89
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,043
How about a dare contest?

90
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,637
That sounds fun!
I dare you to..

91
00:07:52,725 --> 00:07:54,928
climb the TV antenna!

92
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:58,595
- Piece of cake.
- Earthquake!

93
00:08:05,082 --> 00:08:06,511
Aftershock!

94
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,607
Ah Homer, I don’t mean to be
a nervous pervous or anything.

95
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,948
But if he falls, couldn’t that make
your boy parapalegirino?

96
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:19,354
- Shut up Flanders!
- Yeah, Shut up Flanders!

97
00:08:19,361 --> 00:08:20,538
Well said boy!

98
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:25,109
Steady. Steady. Steady..

99
00:08:30,362 --> 00:08:32,674
Hello. Sorry to bother
you on a Sunday.

100
00:08:32,707 --> 00:08:36,624
But I‘m sure you as worried about the
pollution in Lake Springfield as I am.

101
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:46,127
Lake Springfield has higher
levels of mercury than even...

102
00:08:53,237 --> 00:08:56,790
Why, its the little girl
who saved my cat.

103
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,093
Lake Springfield..

104
00:09:08,754 --> 00:09:10,662
Come on over Lisa.

105
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,512
You can canvass me
as long as you want.

106
00:09:13,513 --> 00:09:15,943
Millhouse, You don’t care
about the environment.

107
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,853
Hey! I am very passionate
about the planet!

108
00:09:18,854 --> 00:09:20,436
Say global warming is a myth!

109
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,929
It's a myth!
Further study is needed!

110
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:26,228
That’s for selling out your beliefs!

111
00:09:27,786 --> 00:09:29,970
Oh, poor Millhouse.

112
00:09:30,816 --> 00:09:32,671
Dream coming true.

113
00:09:32,826 --> 00:09:35,493
Are you aware that a leaking
faucet can waste over..

114
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:36,771
2000 Gallons a year.

115
00:09:36,873 --> 00:09:39,582
- And turning off your light can save..
- ..enough energy to power Pittsburgh.

116
00:09:39,586 --> 00:09:42,246
And if we just kept our
thermostats at 68 at the winter..

117
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:45,283
We’d be free from our dependency
on foreign oil in 17 years.

118
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,568
I’m Colin.

119
00:09:47,114 --> 00:09:48,652
I haven’t seen you in school.

120
00:09:48,653 --> 00:09:50,686
I just moved from Ireland.
My dad is a musician.

121
00:09:50,844 --> 00:09:52,339
- Is he..?
- He’s not "Bono".

122
00:09:52,363 --> 00:09:54,603
I just thought because you’re
Irish, and you care about the..

123
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,091
He’s not "Bono"!

124
00:09:56,627 --> 00:09:57,328
Do you play?

125
00:09:57,373 --> 00:09:59,808
Just piano, guitar, trumpet,
drums and bass.

126
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:01,359
<i>He’s pure gold.</i>

127
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:03,956
<i>For once in your life be cool!</i>

128
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:06,285
So, Is your name is pretty
as your face?

129
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,475
You ok there?

130
00:10:15,218 --> 00:10:18,743
Twisted tail! A thousand eyes!
Trapped forever!!

131
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:23,013
- "Epa"! "Epa"!
- "Epa"? What could that be?

132
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,678
I believe it's the sound that
"Green Lantern" made

133
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:27,748
When "Sinestro" threw him
into a bath of acid.

134
00:10:27,766 --> 00:10:30,028
EEEPPPAAA!

135
00:10:30,158 --> 00:10:33,485
Yeah...
Thanks for coming over.

136
00:10:33,712 --> 00:10:35,734
Thanks for giving me your
pregnancy pants.

137
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:37,711
I've never known
comfort like this.

138
00:10:41,424 --> 00:10:42,068
Why did I...

139
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:44,369
suggest this?

140
00:10:54,346 --> 00:10:57,013
Alright boy.
Time for the ultimate dare.

141
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,088
I dare YOU to skateboard to
"Krusty Burger" and back..

142
00:11:03,152 --> 00:11:05,365
<i>NAKED</i>

143
00:11:05,368 --> 00:11:07,082
- How naked?
- "Forth Base".

144
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,520
The girls might see my doodle.

145
00:11:08,613 --> 00:11:13,665
Oh, I see.. Then I hereby
declare you chicken for life.

146
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:17,606
Every morning you’ll wake up to:
"Good Morning Chicken"!

147
00:11:17,703 --> 00:11:20,458
At your wedding I’ll sing:
Bawk bawk bawk bawk.

148
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:21,759
Bawk bawk bawk..

149
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,760
Bawk?!

150
00:11:33,057 --> 00:11:34,997
I like men now.

151
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:36,838
Don’t look where I'm pointing!

152
00:11:55,457 --> 00:11:58,068
<i>Stop in the name of
American squeamishness!</i>

153
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:11,019
Boys before we eat don’t forget to
thank the lord for this bountiful..

154
00:12:11,262 --> 00:12:12,240
Penis!

155
00:12:12,141 --> 00:12:14,451
Bountiful penis.

156
00:12:14,481 --> 00:12:15,617
Amen.

157
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:18,774
Listen kid. Nobody likes
wearing clothes in public.

158
00:12:18,775 --> 00:12:20,902
But you know, It's, It's the law.

159
00:12:24,538 --> 00:12:25,848
Lunch time!

160
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:28,189
You can't just leave me out here!

161
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,938
Don’t worry. We found a
friend for you to play with.

162
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:42,127
Nelson, Honey.
Where have you been?

163
00:12:47,156 --> 00:12:49,602
- Dad!
- What seems to be the problem officers?

164
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,634
Tell them you dared me to do it!

165
00:12:51,651 --> 00:12:55,812
If that’s true, then you should be
taking the rap here, not your son.

166
00:12:57,821 --> 00:13:01,222
And...what happens to
me if its my fault?

167
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:03,967
You’ll have to attend a
one hour parenting class.

168
00:13:03,972 --> 00:13:06,530
It was all his idea!
He’s out of control, I tell you!

169
00:13:06,564 --> 00:13:08,825
I'm at my wit's end.

170
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:13,387
See you in court, kid.

171
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,517
Ok son, lets get some lunch.

172
00:13:15,602 --> 00:13:19,505
- Did you al least bring my clothes?
- Shirt, socks --  everything you need.

173
00:13:19,606 --> 00:13:20,999
You didn’t bring my pants!

174
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,655
Who am I?
"Tommy Bahama"?

175
00:13:23,215 --> 00:13:25,316
This is the worst day of my life.

176
00:13:25,362 --> 00:13:27,821
This is the worst day of
your life so far..

177
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:34,259
- Say Bart..
- What do you want Flanders?

178
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,556
If you need pants,
I carry an extra pair.

179
00:13:36,557 --> 00:13:37,155
I mean..

180
00:13:37,156 --> 00:13:40,224
You know how boys are always,
"Praying through the knees".

181
00:13:40,325 --> 00:13:42,478
Why are you helping me?
I’m not your kid.

182
00:13:42,544 --> 00:13:43,503
We’re neighbors.

183
00:13:43,504 --> 00:13:46,373
I’m sure your father would do
the same for my boys.

184
00:13:46,457 --> 00:13:47,864
Thank you!

185
00:13:55,015 --> 00:13:57,600
- Hey, What’s with you?
- You really wanna know?

186
00:13:57,697 --> 00:14:01,716
Of course I do. What kind of a
father wouldn’t care about a..

187
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:03,054
a pig wearing a hat!

188
00:14:04,256 --> 00:14:04,824
Action!

189
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:07,719
Hey! Hey!
Its your old pal Krusty!

190
00:14:07,753 --> 00:14:10,177
For my new pork sandwich:
"The Clogger".

191
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:14,422
If you can find a greasier sandwich,
you’re in Mexico!

192
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,805
And we’re clear.

193
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:23,286
Perfect.  Cut!   Print!  Kill the pig!

194
00:14:25,242 --> 00:14:28,584
What? You cant kill him if
he’s wearing people clothes.

195
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,746
You’re coming home with me.

196
00:14:47,363 --> 00:14:49,036
A thousand eyes.

197
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,493
What could that be?

198
00:14:51,121 --> 00:14:53,623
I’m pretty sure a thousand...

199
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:54,906
is a number.

200
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,653
Hey Marge!

201
00:14:55,787 --> 00:14:59,548
Isn’t it great being married to
someone who’s recklessly impulsive?

202
00:14:59,641 --> 00:15:02,030
Actually, it's aged me horribly.

203
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:04,905
Then say hello to the newest Simpson!

204
00:15:10,612 --> 00:15:11,777
Homer!

205
00:15:13,277 --> 00:15:17,947
I believe what happened in church
was a warning about precisely this.

206
00:15:17,998 --> 00:15:20,232
Please get rid of that pig.

207
00:15:20,265 --> 00:15:22,018
Oh. You’re gonna love him!

208
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:24,489
Look, He does an
impression of you.

209
00:15:27,482 --> 00:15:29,183
You nailed her.

210
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:31,933
He also does me..

211
00:15:33,163 --> 00:15:34,933
You smiled! I'm off the hook.

212
00:15:43,937 --> 00:15:46,662
Oh, You have so many looks.

213
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,477
So, that’s what snug is.

214
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,714
Who’s a good pig?

215
00:16:08,315 --> 00:16:09,715
Who’s a good pig??

216
00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:15,425
Rough day, huh son?

217
00:16:16,526 --> 00:16:18,787
You don’t know what
rough is, sister.

218
00:16:19,614 --> 00:16:22,372
Bart, you know...whenever my
boys bake up a batch of "frownies".

219
00:16:22,373 --> 00:16:24,501
I take`em fishing.

220
00:16:24,502 --> 00:16:26,577
Does your dad ever
take you fishing?

221
00:16:29,393 --> 00:16:33,068
Dad, Its not fair to use a
"Bug Zapper" to catch the fish.

222
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:36,672
If you like fish like I do,
you want them to die with dignity.

223
00:16:41,724 --> 00:16:43,623
I think I have a nibble.

224
00:16:51,989 --> 00:16:53,602
I think fishing might
be more fun with you.

225
00:16:54,403 --> 00:16:55,403
Oh Great!

226
00:16:55,435 --> 00:16:57,255
Now, How about I
fix you some cocoa?

227
00:16:57,256 --> 00:16:59,156
No way!
Cocoa is for wussies.

228
00:16:59,256 --> 00:17:02,488
Well sir, if you change your
mind its on the window sill.

229
00:17:21,456 --> 00:17:22,919
Oh my god..

230
00:17:24,826 --> 00:17:26,725
Oh wait, I didn’t tell
you the best part.

231
00:17:26,726 --> 00:17:27,946
He loves the environment.

232
00:17:27,979 --> 00:17:30,210
Oh wait, I still didn’t
tell you the best part.

233
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:32,089
He’s got an Irish brogue.

234
00:17:32,123 --> 00:17:34,785
No, No, No. Wait, Wait! I still
didn’t tell you the best part.

235
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:39,074
- He is not imaginary!
- Oh honey that’s great.

236
00:17:39,221 --> 00:17:42,843
But the very best thing
is that he listens to you.

237
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:46,184
Because nothing means
more than for a man to...

238
00:17:46,186 --> 00:17:48,994
How did the pig tracks
get on the ceiling?

239
00:17:48,996 --> 00:17:53,587
Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig.
Does whatever a Spider-Pig does.

240
00:17:53,588 --> 00:17:54,945
Can he swing,

241
00:17:55,037 --> 00:17:56,462
from a web?

242
00:17:56,465 --> 00:17:58,587
No, he can't. He’s a pig.

243
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,080
Lookout..! He is a Spider-Pig.

244
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:09,894
- Are we having fun yet?
- We are now.

245
00:18:09,896 --> 00:18:12,399
- You got a bite.
- Whoa, Momma!

246
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,987
Oh no, my good pole!

247
00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:22,771
- Oh? You're not strangling me.
- What the..?

248
00:18:22,856 --> 00:18:24,415
Strangling is only good for..

249
00:18:25,002 --> 00:18:26,791
Well, It's not really
good for anything.

250
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:28,439
I think the only time you
should lay hands on a boy.

251
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,640
Is when you’re giving him a
good old pat on the back.

252
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,589
Hey, What the hell are you..?

253
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,132
One more time.

254
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:53,142
Honey, I‘m home!

255
00:18:58,714 --> 00:19:00,681
We are at the tipping
point, people.

256
00:19:00,883 --> 00:19:03,237
If we don’t do
something now..

257
00:19:04,106 --> 00:19:06,316
I’m sorry. I lost my
train of thought.

258
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,783
- Isn’t he dreamy?
- Agreed!

259
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,684
Ok. So here is the bottom line:
If we don’t change our ways right now,

260
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:16,358
pollution in Lake Springfield
will be at this level.

261
00:19:17,547 --> 00:19:18,899
That’s not so bad.

262
00:19:19,015 --> 00:19:21,621
No. The lift is stuck.

263
00:19:27,818 --> 00:19:29,709
Am I getting through to anyone?

264
00:19:29,811 --> 00:19:32,701
Hell yeah! We need a new
one of those things.

265
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,010
All in favor of a
new scissor lift, say, "Aye".

266
00:19:35,072 --> 00:19:35,892
Aye!

267
00:19:35,962 --> 00:19:36,293
No!

268
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:41,729
This lake is just one piece of trash
away from a toxic nightmare!

269
00:19:41,846 --> 00:19:45,370
But I knew you wouldn’t listen, so I took
the liberty of pouring water from the lake

270
00:19:45,407 --> 00:19:47,250
in all your drinking classes.

271
00:19:49,046 --> 00:19:50,798
This is why we should
hate kids.

272
00:19:51,218 --> 00:19:54,319
This is serious people.
No more dumping in the lake!

273
00:19:54,324 --> 00:19:57,034
I hereby declare a
state of emergency.

274
00:19:57,209 --> 00:19:59,492
"Code Black".

275
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:00,535
Black?

276
00:20:01,212 --> 00:20:03,149
It's the worst color there is.

277
00:20:03,374 --> 00:20:05,743
- No offence there Carl.
- Nah, I get it all the time.

278
00:20:22,457 --> 00:20:25,034
Sorry. Sorry.
No dumping in the lake.

279
00:20:25,128 --> 00:20:30,604
Fine. I will put my "yard trimmings"
in a car compactor.

280
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,195
Chief I think there was a
dead body in there.

281
00:20:34,314 --> 00:20:37,267
I thought that too
until he said "yard trimmings".

282
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:39,175
You gotta learn to
listen, Lou?

283
00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:43,376
Let us now make sure this
barrier is completely idiot-proof.

284
00:20:43,714 --> 00:20:45,245
- Cletus!
- Yes sir.

285
00:20:45,394 --> 00:20:47,798
Try to dump something in the lake.

286
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:49,591
Ok.

287
00:20:57,248 --> 00:20:59,718
I can't.
I...I simply can't.

288
00:21:00,748 --> 00:21:01,532
Very effective.

289
00:21:13,213 --> 00:21:15,532
Don’t get any ideas!

290
00:21:19,207 --> 00:21:22,555
Maybe we should kiss
just to break the tension.

291
00:21:23,143 --> 00:21:26,133
- What’s going on here?
- Nothing, Nothing.

292
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,630
I’m not sure that pig
should be in the house.

293
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,041
And by the way,
What are you doing with his..?

294
00:21:31,817 --> 00:21:32,872
...leavings.

295
00:21:32,873 --> 00:21:36,173
Don’t worry! I devised the
most elegant solution.

296
00:21:38,421 --> 00:21:41,744
- Oh its leaking!
- Its not leaking..

297
00:21:41,851 --> 00:21:43,691
It's overflowing.

298
00:21:44,027 --> 00:21:47,884
You filled up the whole
silo in just 2 days?

299
00:21:47,996 --> 00:21:48,861
Well I helped.

300
00:21:48,953 --> 00:21:52,591
Homer stop! Stop, I know its easy
for your mind to wonder...

301
00:21:56,088 --> 00:21:59,270
I want you to really
concentrate on me.

302
00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:06,504
I can't escape the feeling that this is
the crisis grandpa warned us about.

303
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,694
You have to dispose of
that waste properly.

304
00:22:10,424 --> 00:22:12,462
Ok Marge.
I will.

305
00:22:12,485 --> 00:22:14,064
You can take Spider-Pig with you.

306
00:22:14,453 --> 00:22:17,011
He’s not Spider-Pig anymore.
He’s "Harry Plopper".

307
00:22:31,104 --> 00:22:33,633
Homer.
You gotta get over here.

308
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:37,098
The health inspector just shut down the donut store,
and they’re giving out free donuts.

309
00:22:36,947 --> 00:22:38,257
Oh my God, Oh my god,
Oh my God!

310
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,324
I just got one thing
I gotta do first.

311
00:22:40,335 --> 00:22:43,056
Alright, but you better hurry.
They’re going fast.

312
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:45,984
Wow, that was close.

313
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:27,806
Evil!

314
00:23:29,613 --> 00:23:31,090
Drive, Drive, Drive!

315
00:23:31,894 --> 00:23:32,997
Oh, Right.

316
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,310
Look at that. You can see the 4
states that border Springfield.

317
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,937
Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky.

318
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:09,961
- Oh yeah.
- And if you look real close you can almost..

319
00:24:13,381 --> 00:24:16,143
Well, this certainly seems odd, but

320
00:24:16,871 --> 00:24:19,559
who am I to question the
work of the Almighty?

321
00:24:21,402 --> 00:24:25,393
We thank you lord for this
mighty fine intelligent design.

322
00:24:25,493 --> 00:24:26,819
Good job!

323
00:24:28,337 --> 00:24:29,971
Jab, jab.
jab, jab, jab.

324
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,733
Hey, jab one more eye
and it's a federal crime.

325
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:36,274
- Who are you?
- Environmental Protection Agency.

326
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:47,368
Russ Cargill. Head of the EPA.
Here to see the President.

327
00:24:52,787 --> 00:24:55,792
- Mr. President.
- Yeah, that is me.

328
00:24:56,532 --> 00:24:59,759
Pollution in Springfield has
reached crisis levels.

329
00:25:01,023 --> 00:25:02,278
I hate this job.

330
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:04,891
Everything is "crisis this" and
"end of the world" that.

331
00:25:04,969 --> 00:25:07,888
Nobody opens with a joke.
I miss Danny DeVito.

332
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,978
You wanna joke, Ha?

333
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,891
Stop me if you’ve
heard this one.

334
00:25:12,633 --> 00:25:15,510
Look at those angry eyes
and those giant teeth.

335
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:17,866
It's like Christmas at
the Kennedy compound.

336
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:20,601
You know sir, when you made
me head of the EPA,

337
00:25:20,781 --> 00:25:24,212
you were applauded for appointing one
of the most successful men in America

338
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:26,379
to the least successful
agency in government.

339
00:25:26,502 --> 00:25:28,091
And why did I take the job?

340
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,047
Because I'm a rich man who
wanted to give something back.

341
00:25:31,257 --> 00:25:32,848
Not the money, but something!

342
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:36,836
So here's our chance to kick
some ass for Mother Earth.

343
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:38,190
I’m listening.

344
00:25:38,424 --> 00:25:42,300
Well, I’ve narrowed your choices
down to 5 unthinkable options.

345
00:25:42,303 --> 00:25:45,510
- Each will cause untold misery..
- I pick number 3!

346
00:25:45,568 --> 00:25:47,256
You don’t even want to
read them first?

347
00:25:47,314 --> 00:25:48,857
I was elected to lead,

348
00:25:48,907 --> 00:25:50,050
not to read.

349
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,211
Number 3!

350
00:26:30,074 --> 00:26:32,089
We’re being sealed in a dome.

351
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:37,083
What do I do?
I don’t know what to do.

352
00:26:37,183 --> 00:26:39,275
If I stay I'm trapped!
If I leave I'm alone!

353
00:26:39,162 --> 00:26:41,235
Oh god!
In? Out? In? Out?

354
00:26:41,313 --> 00:26:42,522
I never saw Venice.

355
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,105
EPA! EPA!

356
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,396
Trapped forever.

357
00:26:57,464 --> 00:26:59,756
Its all come true.

358
00:26:59,922 --> 00:27:03,169
That crazy old man
in church was right!

359
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:10,893
Doooooooooooome!

360
00:27:27,017 --> 00:27:28,921
Alright men, open fire!

361
00:27:30,863 --> 00:27:32,662
Who is hurt?
Raise your hands.

362
00:27:34,247 --> 00:27:35,373
Without the attitude.

363
00:27:35,374 --> 00:27:38,174
People! People! I have an
important announcement!

364
00:27:38,276 --> 00:27:43,416
I've just perfected an acid firing
super drill, which can cut through anything.

365
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:44,417
<i>Yeah he is cool!</i>

366
00:27:44,993 --> 00:27:48,687
It's right there.
Just outside of the dome..

367
00:27:51,138 --> 00:27:54,508
What ruthless madman
could have done this to us?

368
00:27:54,843 --> 00:27:56,779
The United States Government.

369
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:01,263
My name's Russ Cargill
and I'm head of the EPA.

370
00:28:02,753 --> 00:28:05,278
- The what?
- Environmental Protection Agency.

371
00:28:05,348 --> 00:28:07,576
- Come again.
- Look I'm a man on a big TV.

372
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,752
Just listen!

373
00:28:08,843 --> 00:28:11,266
- Springfield has become..
- Whoo Springfield!

374
00:28:11,468 --> 00:28:13,758
..the most polluted city in
the history of the planet.

375
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:15,187
Drama queen!

376
00:28:15,912 --> 00:28:17,355
To prevent your poisons
from spreading,

377
00:28:17,356 --> 00:28:19,710
your government has sealed
you all within this dome.

378
00:28:21,346 --> 00:28:23,199
Believe me, its the last
thing we wanted to do.

379
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,775
I do own the company that makes
the dome, but that's beside the point.

380
00:28:25,776 --> 00:28:27,552
What? You’re telling us
we trapped like rats?

381
00:28:27,683 --> 00:28:29,667
No. Rats can't be
trapped this easily.

382
00:28:29,744 --> 00:28:31,975
You’re trapped like...carrots.

383
00:28:33,637 --> 00:28:35,839
Wait! Wait! We couldn’t
be more polluted.

384
00:28:35,913 --> 00:28:37,978
Everyone stopped
dumping in the lake.

385
00:28:38,054 --> 00:28:40,121
Apparently, someone
didn’t get the message.

386
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:43,445
Act natural.

387
00:28:44,068 --> 00:28:47,441
Hey buddy, sooner or later people
are gonna come by and discover this!

388
00:28:47,755 --> 00:28:51,379
Don’t worry about that. 
We found a way to take you off the map.

389
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,439
<i>Coming up on your right..</i>

390
00:28:55,112 --> 00:28:56,132
<i>Nothing.</i>

391
00:28:57,134 --> 00:28:58,393
This is Kent Brockman reporting to you

392
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,079
on a crisis so serious it has its
own name and theme music.

393
00:29:05,252 --> 00:29:07,268
The dome has put an end
to life as we know it.

394
00:29:07,274 --> 00:29:11,637
The town is running low on supplies
of everything from gasoline to Botox.

395
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,917
Moment please.

396
00:29:17,202 --> 00:29:18,773
Now, as always,

397
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,779
we end our news
on the lighter side.

398
00:29:21,853 --> 00:29:25,234
Its the time of year when the
swallows return to Springfield.

399
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,714
I think the thing I miss most,

400
00:29:37,715 --> 00:29:40,172
is a simple summer breeze.

401
00:29:45,729 --> 00:29:46,740
Maggie?!

402
00:29:48,861 --> 00:29:50,415
<i>We got: Dome wax,
Dome polish, Dome freshener.</i>

403
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:54,625
<i>All your dome needs and dome people. Located
at intersection 105 freeway and the dome.</i>

404
00:29:54,633 --> 00:29:56,501
<i>"Dome Depot".</i>

405
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,739
Maggie got out!
Maggie got out!

406
00:30:01,353 --> 00:30:05,055
Maggie was right there.
Just outside the dome.

407
00:30:05,193 --> 00:30:06,599
Marge, she’s right here.

408
00:30:08,692 --> 00:30:12,629
This dome can play tricks on you.
You just have to keep calm and..

409
00:30:12,694 --> 00:30:15,045
Oh my God!
I’m out of the dome!

410
00:30:15,437 --> 00:30:17,705
Fresh air! Freedom!

411
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:21,414
I’ll write`ya!
Lead good lives!

412
00:30:36,232 --> 00:30:38,227
<i>Good evening this is
Kent Brockman.</i>

413
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:41,170
Efforts to find out whose selfish
crime against the environment,

414
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:43,548
caused our entrapment
have been fruitless.

415
00:30:44,188 --> 00:30:45,709
Until moments ago!

416
00:30:45,995 --> 00:30:49,057
A shocking discovery has been
made here at Lake Springfield.

417
00:30:50,377 --> 00:30:53,007
Ah, it can be
anybody's pig crap silo.

418
00:30:56,892 --> 00:31:00,193
Homer! It was you!

419
00:31:00,397 --> 00:31:03,268
You single handedly
killed this town!

420
00:31:03,374 --> 00:31:05,438
I know. It's weird.

421
00:31:05,537 --> 00:31:08,945
Just a reminder: This station does
not endorse vigilante justice.

422
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,593
Unless it gets results.

423
00:31:10,598 --> 00:31:11,854
Which it will.

424
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:17,305
You didn’t listen to me
after I warned you!?

425
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:19,889
Don’t worry. Nobody
watches this stupid show.

426
00:31:21,236 --> 00:31:23,174
Whats that ominous
glow in the distance?

427
00:31:26,979 --> 00:31:36,060
Kill! Kill! Kill!

428
00:31:37,082 --> 00:31:40,527
Marge, look! Those idiots
don’t even know where we live

429
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,357
Kill! Kill! Kill!

430
00:31:44,961 --> 00:31:47,894
We want Homer!
We want Homer!

431
00:31:47,898 --> 00:31:50,369
Monster! You monster!!

432
00:31:50,944 --> 00:31:54,136
- Did you see the news?
- Honey come on. We have bigger problems.

433
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:56,529
But im so angry!

434
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:59,552
You’re a woman.
You can hold on to it forever.

435
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,513
Ok.

436
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:07,131
Homer, you have to go
out there, face that mob,

437
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:10,453
- and apologize for what you did.
- I would,

438
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:12,803
but I’m afraid if I open the
door they'll take all of you.

439
00:32:12,846 --> 00:32:14,919
<i>No we wont!
We just want Homer!</i>

440
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,215
Well, maybe not you.
But they'll kill grandpa!

441
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,026
<i>I'm part of the mob!</i>

442
00:32:21,631 --> 00:32:23,554
Teeny, take out the baby.

443
00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:38,288
Here, Let me get that for you.

444
00:32:45,456 --> 00:32:47,139
Stay back! I got a chainsaw!

445
00:32:59,089 --> 00:33:01,299
Bart, crawl across. Hurry!

446
00:33:01,557 --> 00:33:03,780
But if they see you trying
to help us they'll kill you.

447
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,567
Oh pashaw! I’m sure your
father would do the same for..

448
00:33:07,872 --> 00:33:09,677
Point taken.
Now  hustle your bussels!

449
00:33:13,647 --> 00:33:14,710
Archers!

450
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:18,209
I’m using an red arrow,
so I know who I kill.

451
00:33:21,214 --> 00:33:22,592
No, Plopper!

452
00:33:22,774 --> 00:33:25,351
If you’ll push that,
daddy will die.

453
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:32,604
Hey, my luck’s beginning to turn!

454
00:33:36,555 --> 00:33:38,474
Wait! 
There’s something I have to get!

455
00:33:55,055 --> 00:33:57,131
- What did you get?
- Our wedding video.

456
00:33:58,165 --> 00:33:59,275
We have a wedding video?

457
00:33:59,276 --> 00:34:00,776
<i>Torch his gas tank!</i>

458
00:34:04,173 --> 00:34:05,578
We lost them!

459
00:34:19,846 --> 00:34:20,638
Uh, Up here!

460
00:34:23,116 --> 00:34:23,999
<i>Get them! Get them!</i>

461
00:34:28,072 --> 00:34:29,380
Uh, a little help?

462
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:39,443
You know, the word "apology"
is tossed around a lot these days.

463
00:34:39,693 --> 00:34:41,604
but when it comes from in here...

464
00:34:53,612 --> 00:34:55,420
Mom! What are we gonna do?

465
00:34:58,294 --> 00:34:59,699
Maggie, not now!

466
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,637
We’ll play later!

467
00:35:09,592 --> 00:35:11,521
A sinkhole.

468
00:35:11,584 --> 00:35:13,149
Follow me kids!

469
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:15,411
- Geronimo!
- Sacajawea!

470
00:35:20,249 --> 00:35:21,942
So long, losers!

471
00:35:28,658 --> 00:35:31,388
The top of his head is still showing. 
Claw on it!

472
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:07,306
Well, they’re
China’s problem now.

473
00:36:17,774 --> 00:36:18,817
Colin!

474
00:36:25,597 --> 00:36:27,601
I can't hear you!

475
00:36:46,987 --> 00:36:51,347
I never thought my life would have an
absolutely perfect moment, but this...

476
00:36:51,348 --> 00:36:54,524
Lisa's got a boyfriend
that she’ll never see again!

477
00:36:55,884 --> 00:36:57,106
Perfect.

478
00:37:07,596 --> 00:37:08,601
What do we do?

479
00:37:08,871 --> 00:37:10,356
Now, we run.

480
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:16,948
I’m afraid we lost them sir.

481
00:37:18,223 --> 00:37:21,149
Well then, you find them. 
And you get them back in the dome!

482
00:37:21,421 --> 00:37:22,888
And to make sure
nobody else gets out,

483
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:25,657
I want roving gas squads
around the perimeter 24/7.

484
00:37:25,749 --> 00:37:27,402
I want 10,000 tough guys,

485
00:37:27,405 --> 00:37:28,749
and I want 10,000 soft guys

486
00:37:28,761 --> 00:37:30,353
to make the tough
guys look tougher.

487
00:37:30,546 --> 00:37:31,864
And here is how I want
them arranged:

488
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,658
Tough, Tough, Soft, Tough,

489
00:37:33,735 --> 00:37:35,645
Soft, Soft, Tough, Tough,

490
00:37:35,776 --> 00:37:37,653
Soft, Soft, Tough, Soft.

491
00:37:39,155 --> 00:37:42,074
Sir, I’m afraid you’ve
gone mad with power.

492
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:44,259
Of course I have.
You ever try going mad without power?

493
00:37:44,316 --> 00:37:45,991
Its boring!
No one listens to you.

494
00:38:14,314 --> 00:38:17,228
- Bart, are you drinking whisky?
- I’m troubled.

495
00:38:17,229 --> 00:38:19,538
- Bart!
- I promise I’ll stop tomorrow.

496
00:38:19,645 --> 00:38:21,482
You’ll stop right now!

497
00:38:26,482 --> 00:38:27,827
Come back here, Little man!

498
00:38:30,387 --> 00:38:33,891
I miss Flanders.
There, I said it!

499
00:38:35,088 --> 00:38:36,954
- Where’s your father?
- He went out.

500
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:39,567
Lets quickly rebuild our
lives while he’s gone.

501
00:38:39,688 --> 00:38:43,681
Hey guys? 
What’s the secret knock again?

502
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:50,215
Look I know I screwed up.
This is big.

503
00:38:50,316 --> 00:38:54,681
Its huge! We’re homeless!
Our friends wanna kill us.

504
00:38:54,937 --> 00:38:57,323
Before we can even stay
in the same room with you,

505
00:38:57,356 --> 00:39:02,228
I need to know what was going through
your mind when you didn’t listen to me?

506
00:39:02,429 --> 00:39:05,148
and dumped that silo in the lake.

507
00:39:06,241 --> 00:39:07,024
Homer!

508
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:10,719
I don’t know what to tell you Marge.
I don’t think about things.

509
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:12,845
I respect people who do,
but..

510
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,444
I just try to make
the days not hurt

511
00:39:15,465 --> 00:39:18,139
until I get to crawl in
next to you again.

512
00:39:19,003 --> 00:39:20,855
Oh...

513
00:39:21,385 --> 00:39:22,603
I mean, OH!

514
00:39:23,024 --> 00:39:26,547
Look, I’m really sorry.
But I'm more than just sorry.

515
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,264
I’m prepared with a solution.

516
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:33,092
I’ve always been afraid that I’d screw up
our lives so badly that we need a backup plan.

517
00:39:33,918 --> 00:39:37,592
And that plan is right here!

518
00:39:39,249 --> 00:39:40,027
No..

519
00:39:41,205 --> 00:39:41,861
Nope.

520
00:39:42,367 --> 00:39:43,318
Bingo!

521
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:48,553
Stay with me.

522
00:39:53,469 --> 00:39:54,667
Alaska?

523
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:58,452
Alaska!  A place where you
can't be too fat or too drunk.

524
00:39:58,667 --> 00:40:03,089
Where no one says things like, "Lets
see your high school equivalency certificate."

525
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:08,332
- I don’t know Homie.
- Oh, I’m not saying it right.

526
00:40:08,687 --> 00:40:12,202
Look, the thing is I can't
start a new life alone.

527
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,013
And I've really come to like you guys.

528
00:40:16,935 --> 00:40:18,896
I just don’t see it.

529
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:26,943
Marge, in every marriage
you get one chance to say,

530
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,139
"I need you to do this with me."

531
00:40:31,422 --> 00:40:34,754
And there is only one
answer when somebody says that..

532
00:40:40,057 --> 00:40:43,401
Ok Hommie, I’m with you.

533
00:40:43,398 --> 00:40:45,175
Thank you my sweetheart.

534
00:40:45,629 --> 00:40:47,374
- Mom.
- Yes honey?

535
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:52,971
You just bought another load of crap
from the world’s fattest fertilizer salesman.

536
00:40:53,138 --> 00:40:55,591
You’ll pay for ruining this
golden family moment!

537
00:40:55,592 --> 00:40:56,482
Homer!

538
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:59,783
How we supposed to get to
Alaska without any money?

539
00:41:00,312 --> 00:41:04,631
Alright son! If you don’t believe
in me, believe in America!

540
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,888
America! Where any man
can make quick money,

541
00:41:07,889 --> 00:41:10,257
with no questions asked.

542
00:41:13,469 --> 00:41:15,664
<i>Step right up and win my truck!</i>

543
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:18,904
<i>All you have to do is conquer
"The Ball of Death".</i>

544
00:41:18,938 --> 00:41:20,381
- What’s the catch?
- No catch.

545
00:41:20,481 --> 00:41:24,418
Just ride the motorcycle all
the way around just one time.

546
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:26,366
3 Tries for $10.

547
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,067
Marge, how much
money do we have?

548
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,313
$10.

549
00:41:32,183 --> 00:41:33,407
That counts as a try.

550
00:41:37,902 --> 00:41:38,854
<i>That’s two.</i>

551
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:42,721
<i>And that’s three.</i>

552
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:43,779
Tell you what I'm gonna do...

553
00:41:43,788 --> 00:41:45,634
Just cause I like to see
you hurt yourself.

554
00:41:45,635 --> 00:41:47,347
I’ll give you one
"On the House".

555
00:41:47,548 --> 00:41:49,411
- You are the best.
- Dad!

556
00:41:49,552 --> 00:41:53,041
When you’re get to the top,
don’t slow down. Speed up!

557
00:41:53,142 --> 00:41:55,992
- But that’s where it's the scariest!
- Just do it!

558
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:08,751
Yes!!

559
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:11,831
<i>Yes! Yes!</i>

560
00:42:19,763 --> 00:42:21,111
I’ll take that truck now.

561
00:42:24,389 --> 00:42:26,950
Oh man...
My wives are gonna kill me.

562
00:42:28,767 --> 00:42:31,141
Next stop, Alaska!

563
00:42:37,683 --> 00:42:39,724
Day 37 under the dome.

564
00:42:39,869 --> 00:42:42,597
We are facing
intermittent power failures which...

565
00:42:46,581 --> 00:42:49,656
Ok, very funny. 
Now I'm gonna turn the lights off again.

566
00:42:49,772 --> 00:42:53,139
When it comes back on, I want
all my booze back the way it was.

567
00:42:57,332 --> 00:42:59,638
Yeah, Ok, Ok...

568
00:43:06,486 --> 00:43:10,520
I’m very proud of you Bart.
Over 24 hours sober!

569
00:43:10,732 --> 00:43:12,691
- You are aren’t you?
- I’ll proove it.

570
00:43:18,288 --> 00:43:21,957
Look, we’re giving your father another
chance, and we owe it to him to...

571
00:43:22,862 --> 00:43:25,124
- Oh my God!
- Can I help you?

572
00:43:27,295 --> 00:43:29,660
- We need diapers.
- Ok.

573
00:43:30,061 --> 00:43:33,566
No...no we don’t...
ladies razor blades.

574
00:43:33,567 --> 00:43:33,667
Great.

575
00:43:33,675 --> 00:43:36,386
No..no..no we don’t!
I forgot! We’re European.

576
00:43:37,446 --> 00:43:39,019
Just give us beef jerky.

577
00:43:39,152 --> 00:43:43,334
Lots and lots of beef jerky.
That’s right. That’s what we need.

578
00:43:43,335 --> 00:43:45,035
That’s all we came in for...

579
00:43:45,035 --> 00:43:45,627
Sure.

580
00:43:49,298 --> 00:43:51,326
Oh my God! There...
There they are!

581
00:44:10,338 --> 00:44:14,460
So, you want some of my
electricity, do you?

582
00:44:15,411 --> 00:44:18,638
Well, for once the rich
white man is in control.

583
00:44:19,136 --> 00:44:20,934
I have two buttons
behind this desk.

584
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:25,437
One will supply your town with power.
The other releases the hounds.

585
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,680
Reach me.
Make me your brother.

586
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:32,239
The hospital’s generator is about
to give out.  Lives will be lost!

587
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:34,884
Lives lost.

588
00:44:35,634 --> 00:44:36,262
Go on.

589
00:44:36,263 --> 00:44:39,463
We got a convict we were gonna
fry tomorrow, but now we can't.

590
00:44:39,587 --> 00:44:41,705
Tempting...tempting...

591
00:44:41,906 --> 00:44:43,506
Look all our reasons
mean nothing..

592
00:44:43,655 --> 00:44:46,609
Just look into your heart,
and you’ll find the answer.

593
00:44:50,574 --> 00:44:52,550
- First door on the right.
- Thank you!

594
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,087
What? This isn’t the way I
pictured Alaska at all.

595
00:45:04,876 --> 00:45:07,039
- Oh, That’s better.
- Homer!

596
00:45:14,264 --> 00:45:16,492
Well at least my
poster didn’t get torn.

597
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:30,896
Welcome to Alaska!
Here’s a $1,000.

598
00:45:31,214 --> 00:45:33,509
Well, its about time!
But why?

599
00:45:33,595 --> 00:45:35,643
We pay every resident a $1,000,

600
00:45:35,677 --> 00:45:38,656
to allowed the oil companies to ravage
our state's natural beauty.

601
00:45:38,911 --> 00:45:41,872
- I’m home!
-Oh thanks.

602
00:45:59,613 --> 00:46:02,675
- What are you doing Bart?
- Just passing the time.

603
00:46:15,777 --> 00:46:19,358
Oh, my boy loves Alaska so
much he’s applauding it.

604
00:46:19,949 --> 00:46:22,283
- Lisa, why aren’t you clapping?
- But dad..

605
00:46:22,316 --> 00:46:23,989
Clap for Alaska!

606
00:46:39,824 --> 00:46:44,333
Well Marge, we’re separated
from the kids by a wall of snow.

607
00:46:44,476 --> 00:46:47,090
All my dreams are coming true.

608
00:47:40,252 --> 00:47:42,281
Day 93 under the dome.

609
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:44,368
With necessities growing
dangerously low,

610
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:47,469
who knows what spark will set
off this powder keg.

611
00:47:47,517 --> 00:47:50,053
Ok, Lets discuss
"Tuesdays with Maury".

612
00:47:50,054 --> 00:47:53,866
Again? If we don’t get a
new book I'm going to puke.

613
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:56,427
You’re the five people I'm
gonna meet in hell!

614
00:47:59,302 --> 00:48:01,207
We’re out of coffee!

615
00:48:03,162 --> 00:48:06,298
<i>I cant take another
minute in this dome!</i>

616
00:48:16,674 --> 00:48:18,178
Take that!

617
00:48:18,794 --> 00:48:20,583
Oh no, blowback!

618
00:48:26,591 --> 00:48:28,143
Look what they’re
doing to our dome.

619
00:48:35,457 --> 00:48:37,518
- You know what that is sir?
- A crack?

620
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:38,319
Exactly.

621
00:48:38,758 --> 00:48:40,820
First, let me state the problem.
People got out of the dome before,

622
00:48:40,821 --> 00:48:41,921
they’re gonna get out again.

623
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,832
And when they do, there’s
gonna be hearings, investigations..

624
00:48:44,836 --> 00:48:48,596
????????!  I’ll have to go
back to making family comedies.

625
00:48:50,353 --> 00:48:54,916
Don’t worry! I have a solution for you sir.  
In fact, I have 5 solutions.

626
00:48:55,001 --> 00:48:57,552
You don’t even have to read them,
You’ll have deniability.

627
00:48:57,585 --> 00:48:59,841
I’ll take care of everything.
You know nothing.

628
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:02,417
No!
I need to know what im approving.

629
00:49:02,451 --> 00:49:06,284
Absolutely! But on the other hand,
knowing things is over rated.

630
00:49:06,367 --> 00:49:08,749
Anyone can pick something
when they know what it is..

631
00:49:08,764 --> 00:49:12,151
I takes real leadership to pick
something you’re clueless about.

632
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,891
- Ok, I pick 3.
- Try again.

633
00:49:14,915 --> 00:49:15,916
- One.
- Go higher.

634
00:49:15,946 --> 00:49:16,798
- 5.
- Too high.

635
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:17,968
- 3?
- You already said 3.

636
00:49:18,002 --> 00:49:18,864
- 6?
- There is no 6.

637
00:49:18,898 --> 00:49:19,882
- 2?
- Double it.

638
00:49:19,896 --> 00:49:21,524
- 4!
- As you wish sir.

639
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:36,308
Are you tired of the
same old "Grand Canyon"?

640
00:49:36,852 --> 00:49:39,613
Here we are kids,
The "Grand Canyon".

641
00:49:39,879 --> 00:49:43,790
It's so old and boring.
I want a new one. Now!

642
00:49:44,386 --> 00:49:46,145
Hello! I’m Tom Hanks.

643
00:49:46,346 --> 00:49:50,731
The U.S Government has lost its credibility,
so its borrowing some of mine.

644
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:53,553
- Tussel my hair, Mr. Hanks.
- Sure thing, son.

645
00:49:55,704 --> 00:49:59,104
Now, I’m pleased to tell you all
about the new "Grand Canyon".

646
00:49:58,933 --> 00:50:00,100
Coming this weekend!

647
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:02,605
Its east of Shabbiville and
south of Capital City.

648
00:50:02,878 --> 00:50:04,561
That’s where Springfield is!

649
00:50:04,565 --> 00:50:07,151
Its no where near where
anything is or ever was.

650
00:50:07,281 --> 00:50:08,881
This is Tom Hanks saying
if you’re going to pick

651
00:50:08,882 --> 00:50:11,042
a government to trust,
why not this one?

652
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:13,081
Did you see that?

653
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,662
Yes, they’re going
to destroy Springfield!

654
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,437
But, we’re going to stop them.

655
00:50:17,553 --> 00:50:19,208
Homie! Get your clothes on.

656
00:50:19,489 --> 00:50:22,853
- Homie?
- I’m happy here - screw Springfield!

657
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:27,063
I cant believe you’d say
something so selfish.

658
00:50:27,143 --> 00:50:30,325
Marge, those people chased
us with pitchforks and torches.

659
00:50:30,404 --> 00:50:33,787
- Torches! At 4 in the afternoon!
- It was 7 at night.

660
00:50:33,856 --> 00:50:35,569
It was during "Access Hollywood".

661
00:50:35,636 --> 00:50:37,697
Which is on at 4 and 7.

662
00:50:38,367 --> 00:50:41,494
Dad, how can you turn your back
on everyone who loved us?

663
00:50:41,553 --> 00:50:43,306
Flanders helped us when
we were in trouble.

664
00:50:43,314 --> 00:50:45,741
Who cares what Flanders did?
He’s not your father.

665
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:46,964
I wish he was.

666
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:49,173
You don’t mean that,
You worship me.

667
00:50:49,176 --> 00:50:51,373
Oh yeah? Look what I
did to your picture.

668
00:50:51,919 --> 00:50:52,916
Look at it!

669
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:54,117
Howdily doodley!

670
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:55,418
Howdily doodley!
Howdily doodley!

671
00:50:55,466 --> 00:50:56,477
You little..

672
00:50:57,136 --> 00:50:59,817
- You..I'll strangle wangle you!
- Dudley, Dudley.

673
00:51:00,562 --> 00:51:02,987
Bart! Stop it!
Leave this to me.

674
00:51:04,235 --> 00:51:09,706
Homer, in every marriage you
get one chance to say,

675
00:51:09,874 --> 00:51:12,610
"I need you to do this with me."

676
00:51:14,364 --> 00:51:17,999
That is the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

677
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:21,010
- Homer Simpson!
- We’re saving Springfield!

678
00:51:21,086 --> 00:51:23,380
Listen to me - all of you!
We are staying!

679
00:51:23,423 --> 00:51:27,713
We have great life here in Alaska, and we
are never going back to America again!

680
00:51:28,486 --> 00:51:29,663
<i>I have spoken!</i>

681
00:51:49,003 --> 00:51:53,272
Well, I guess I’ve let her
worry about me long enough.

682
00:52:05,419 --> 00:52:07,568
Marge? Kids?

683
00:52:20,792 --> 00:52:21,961
Ok, Here it goes.

684
00:52:22,729 --> 00:52:28,713
Homer, I’ve always stood up for you
when people point out your flaws.

685
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:36,436
I always say, "Well, sometimes you have to
stand back to appreciate a work of art."

686
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,954
Way back.

687
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:42,097
"Lately, what's keeping us together

688
00:52:42,831 --> 00:52:46,531
is my ability to overlook
everything you do."

689
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:51,778
"And I overlooked these things because.."

- Because?

690
00:52:53,197 --> 00:52:58,669
"Well that’s the thing. I just don’t know
how to finish that sentence anymore."

691
00:53:00,153 --> 00:53:03,247
"So, I’m leaving with the kids
to help Springfield."


692
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:05,953
"And we’re never coming back."

693
00:53:09,609 --> 00:53:12,459
"And to prove to myself
that this is the end..

694
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:17,446
I taped this over our wedding video."

695
00:53:19,275 --> 00:53:20,683
"Goodbye Homie."

696
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,087
"I love you!"


697
00:53:40,106 --> 00:53:42,597
Marge? Kids?

698
00:54:32,466 --> 00:54:35,598
- So, Mom, What’s our plan?
- What are you doing up there?

699
00:54:35,645 --> 00:54:37,137
Looking through people’s luggage..

700
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:40,053
I am the mascot of
an evil corporation.

701
00:54:40,808 --> 00:54:44,113
Get down from there!
We have to keep a low profile.

702
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:48,223
Till we get to Seattle to tell the world of
the plot to destroy Springfield.

703
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:50,868
I don’t know if you guys
should be talking so loud.

704
00:54:50,965 --> 00:54:55,133
No, Lisa. Its not like the government
is listening to everybody’s conversation.

705
00:55:03,106 --> 00:55:05,239
<I>Hi. I'm calling about
your meat lovers pizza.

706
00:55:05,264 --> 00:55:08,535
<I>I like meat, but I don’t know if
I'm ready to love again.

707
00:55:08,689 --> 00:55:12,436
<I>- You hang up first. 
- No, you hang up first.
- Ok.

708
00:55:13,557 --> 00:55:14,890
<i>She hung up on me.</i>

709
00:55:15,375 --> 00:55:17,098
<i>But we are fugitives</i>

710
00:55:17,335 --> 00:55:19,587
<i>We should just lay low
till we get to Seattle.</i>

711
00:55:19,877 --> 00:55:21,428
Hey everybody! I found one!

712
00:55:21,761 --> 00:55:25,487
The government actually found
someone we’re looking for!

713
00:55:25,645 --> 00:55:27,534
Yeah baby, Yeah!

714
00:55:29,179 --> 00:55:30,415
<i>Homer Simpson.</i>

715
00:55:31,988 --> 00:55:33,919
Do you know why you are here?

716
00:55:33,951 --> 00:55:38,093
Cause my family cares more about
other people than they do about me.

717
00:55:38,105 --> 00:55:39,586
Drink this liquid.

718
00:55:42,677 --> 00:55:43,749
More please.

719
00:55:44,921 --> 00:55:46,766
Now, we will cleanse your spirit,

720
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,292
by the ancient Inuit art
of throat singing.

721
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:51,858
Throat singing?

722
00:56:02,555 --> 00:56:06,818
- How long are we doing this?
- Until you have an epiphany!

723
00:56:07,419 --> 00:56:08,386
Ok.

724
00:56:11,205 --> 00:56:12,311
What’s an epiphany?

725
00:56:12,496 --> 00:56:16,573
- Sudden realization of great truth.
- Ok

726
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:33,633
<i>Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig.</i>

727
00:56:34,032 --> 00:56:38,410
<i>Does what ever a Spider-Pig does.</i>

728
00:56:38,621 --> 00:56:43,526
<i>He`s a Spider-Pig.</i>

729
00:56:44,396 --> 00:56:50,384
Unless you have an epiphany, you will
spend the reminder of your days alone.

730
00:56:52,341 --> 00:56:53,997
An epiphany, epiphany, epiphany.

731
00:56:54,173 --> 00:56:57,800
Bananas are an excellent
source of potassium.

732
00:56:59,501 --> 00:57:01,389
Americans will never embrace soccer?

733
00:57:04,165 --> 00:57:06,173
More than 2 shakes and it's
playing with yourself?

734
00:57:09,436 --> 00:57:11,003
Hey! What are you doing?

735
00:57:15,257 --> 00:57:18,640
Ah, do whatever you want to me.
I don’t care about myself anymore.

736
00:57:21,364 --> 00:57:22,717
Because..?

737
00:57:24,187 --> 00:57:27,541
Because other people are just
as important as me.

738
00:57:28,665 --> 00:57:31,874
Without them, I’m nothing.

739
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:40,114
In order to save myself,
I have to save Springfield!

740
00:57:40,155 --> 00:57:42,431
That’s it!
Isn’t it?

741
00:57:55,258 --> 00:57:58,045
It was the most incredible
experience of my life.

742
00:57:58,065 --> 00:58:02,962
And now to find my family, save
my town and drop 10 pounds!

743
00:58:03,807 --> 00:58:05,783
Thank you boob lady!

744
00:58:12,808 --> 00:58:15,213
This is it kids, Seattle.

745
00:58:15,977 --> 00:58:17,422
Russ Cargill!

746
00:58:17,363 --> 00:58:18,862
Do you think he saw us?

747
00:58:22,585 --> 00:58:24,144
Yes, I did.

748
00:58:28,747 --> 00:58:30,675
Run! Run!

749
00:58:30,864 --> 00:58:33,076
Run! Run!

750
00:58:33,072 --> 00:58:35,093
Run! Run!

751
00:58:35,373 --> 00:58:37,302
Jump! Jump!

752
00:58:37,726 --> 00:58:39,798
Land! Land!

753
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,863
Rest! Rest!

754
00:58:42,364 --> 00:58:44,216
Run! Run!

755
00:58:46,425 --> 00:58:48,058
I know we’ve had a rough day,

756
00:58:48,054 --> 00:58:50,799
but im sure we can put all
this behind us and just..

757
00:58:54,445 --> 00:58:55,933
It's my whipping arm!

758
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:01,791
Oh, why does everything
I whip leave me?

759
00:59:03,509 --> 00:59:07,313
Must keep going..
Must keep going..

760
00:59:07,681 --> 00:59:11,395
No, I can't..
I can't keep going..

761
00:59:11,696 --> 00:59:15,428
- Yes, You can!
- No I can't!

762
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:20,326
Oh, shut up! You shut up!
No you!

763
00:59:20,415 --> 00:59:24,024
No you! No you!
Oh, real mature!

764
00:59:24,178 --> 00:59:26,088
How can you say that?

765
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,055
Oh, what’s the point?
It's hopeless.

766
00:59:38,613 --> 00:59:41,935
Don’t give up Homer.
You are closer than you think.

767
00:59:42,028 --> 00:59:43,760
But which way do I go?

768
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:50,470
Much obliged.

769
01:00:04,576 --> 01:00:06,136
Attenhut!

770
01:00:11,864 --> 01:00:14,107
Lisa, knock off that racket!

771
01:00:14,035 --> 01:00:15,055
Lisa!

772
01:00:17,158 --> 01:00:19,965
- They captured my family.
- What do I do? What do I do?

773
01:00:25,573 --> 01:00:28,993
There is something strange
about that "Sop" sign.

774
01:00:46,765 --> 01:00:49,005
- Did you hear something?
- Probably just a moth.

775
01:00:49,006 --> 01:00:50,554
I hope it's ok.

776
01:01:13,379 --> 01:01:15,859
Look look look. We cant keep
stopping at every "Sop", "Yelled"

777
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:18,116
or "One-Vay" sign.
Just move on!

778
01:01:24,075 --> 01:01:27,940
- Let us out! Let us out!
- Stop that! You’ll scratch your shackles!

779
01:01:27,941 --> 01:01:29,688
I hope I do!

780
01:01:36,425 --> 01:01:41,005
- Oh, way to go Bart!
- You stink!

781
01:01:41,006 --> 01:01:44,334
No, you stink..

782
01:01:59,404 --> 01:02:01,233
Springfield?!

783
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:03,926
I cant believe it.
But it got even crappier.

784
01:02:07,759 --> 01:02:09,307
Oh, man!

785
01:02:18,597 --> 01:02:19,757
Hi there, Marge.

786
01:02:19,804 --> 01:02:24,077
- Moe, what happened? 
- With the town sealed off from the rest of the world,

787
01:02:24,078 --> 01:02:27,771
- things got a little nutty here.
- Why you dressed like that?

788
01:02:27,772 --> 01:02:32,249
Well, I don’t like to brag, but I am
now the Emperor of Springfield!

789
01:02:32,442 --> 01:02:35,426
- No, You’re not!
- Yes I am!

790
01:02:36,864 --> 01:02:39,555
Ok..
Hail Emperor!

791
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:41,620
Attention Springfield!

792
01:02:43,157 --> 01:02:47,418
Your government has realized that putting
you inside this dome was a terrible mistake.

793
01:02:47,422 --> 01:02:50,772
Therefore, we're commencing with
operation "Soaring Eagle".

794
01:02:50,773 --> 01:02:52,068
Yeah!

795
01:02:52,161 --> 01:02:54,090
Which involves killing you all.

796
01:03:01,435 --> 01:03:05,631
As I speak, we’re lowering a small but
powerful bomb onto your midst.

797
01:03:14,103 --> 01:03:17,364
Despite everything,
I miss your father.

798
01:03:17,923 --> 01:03:21,689
Me too. His big fat ass
could shield us all.

799
01:03:26,684 --> 01:03:28,292
Attenhut!

800
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:32,613
Release!
I’m general.. "Merriot Suites".

801
01:03:32,674 --> 01:03:34,724
And I have an urgent
note from the President.

802
01:03:35,108 --> 01:03:37,645
Its says to release
this town immediately.

803
01:03:37,759 --> 01:03:39,543
Why is it written on a leaf?

804
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:01,000
Perfect!

805
01:04:03,942 --> 01:04:08,595
Now, Homer Simpson's gonna
show he has cojones! Oops...

806
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:28,711
- Mom, I’ve gotta go find Colin.
- Not now sweetie.

807
01:04:28,709 --> 01:04:31,189
Doomsday is family time.

808
01:04:36,221 --> 01:04:38,877
Hey, if one of us distracts Cargill,

809
01:04:38,878 --> 01:04:40,816
then the rest of us can
climb up that thing.

810
01:04:40,913 --> 01:04:43,803
Who’d be dumb enough to stay behind
while we escape with our lives?

811
01:04:45,245 --> 01:04:47,116
My time to shine.

812
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:50,985
Hey, Mr. Big TV man, lookie here!

813
01:04:51,476 --> 01:04:56,427
- What do you want?
- Look what I can do with my thumb.

814
01:04:57,929 --> 01:04:59,866
You wanna know how I do it?

815
01:04:59,867 --> 01:05:01,654
Four generations of inbreeding?

816
01:05:17,307 --> 01:05:18,946
I can smell fresh air!

817
01:05:19,777 --> 01:05:21,506
I can hear birds!

818
01:05:21,846 --> 01:05:25,804
- I taste freedom!
- Excuse me, watch out, coming through!

819
01:05:33,935 --> 01:05:37,300
- I was tricked by an idiot!
- Hey, I know how you feel.

820
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:40,474
I was beat in tic-tac-toe
by a chicken.

821
01:05:41,172 --> 01:05:41,707
Goodbye.

822
01:05:45,088 --> 01:05:46,802
Homie - do good?

823
01:05:47,069 --> 01:05:49,032
Actually you doomed us all.

824
01:05:49,334 --> 01:05:51,303
Again. Nice knowing you Homer.

825
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:52,838
But...

826
01:05:56,021 --> 01:05:58,364
I can't do anything right!

827
01:06:01,722 --> 01:06:03,218
Get out of here!

828
01:06:10,773 --> 01:06:14,402
I’ve spent my entire life doing nothing
but collecting comic books.

829
01:06:14,627 --> 01:06:19,426
And now there is only time to say..
Life well spent!

830
01:06:24,003 --> 01:06:25,074
Ok, boys.

831
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:28,636
When you meet Jesus,
Be sure to call him Mr. Christ.

832
01:06:28,715 --> 01:06:31,276
- Will Buddha be there too?
- No!

833
01:06:31,947 --> 01:06:35,310
- Hey Flanders.
- Bart! How good to see ya!

834
01:06:35,855 --> 01:06:38,779
- And how terrible you’re here.
- Thanks.

835
01:06:39,736 --> 01:06:43,418
Listen, I was just wondering if..

836
01:06:44,177 --> 01:06:49,628
before I died, I could
pretend I had a father who..

837
01:06:50,369 --> 01:06:51,697
cared for me.

838
01:06:52,917 --> 01:06:57,049
Come here son. There is always room
for one more in the Flanders clan.

839
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:05,446
Come on bomb disarming robot,
you’re our last hope!

840
01:07:05,634 --> 01:07:10,093
Red wire? Blue wire?
Black is usually the ground.

841
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:13,099
So much pressure..

842
01:07:14,187 --> 01:07:15,287
Pressure!

843
01:07:19,028 --> 01:07:22,282
He’d been talking about it,
but I didn’t take him seriously.

844
01:07:28,075 --> 01:07:31,316
Marge! Marge! Marge!

845
01:07:32,657 --> 01:07:34,308
Oh, No!
The "Epiphatree".

846
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:37,644
Hey I tried my best.
What am I supposed to do?

847
01:07:39,587 --> 01:07:41,884
And how am I supposed
to get up there?

848
01:07:47,391 --> 01:07:49,516
Here, buy yourself something nice.

849
01:07:54,305 --> 01:07:57,155
Homer? What the hell
are you doing now?

850
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:00,990
Risking my life to save people I hate
for reasons I don’t quite understand.

851
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:02,236
Gotta go!

852
01:08:02,866 --> 01:08:04,724
First, one stop.

853
01:08:11,625 --> 01:08:13,707
Bart? Son?

854
01:08:14,426 --> 01:08:18,939
You think you can find it in your heart to
give your foolish old man one more chance?

855
01:08:19,986 --> 01:08:22,089
I don’t know..

856
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:23,300
It seems to me, son

857
01:08:23,301 --> 01:08:27,094
your father's saying he wants to
spend his last minutes with you.

858
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,371
No, I cant do it!

859
01:08:32,666 --> 01:08:35,832
I want a father who’s the same
in the morning as he is at night.

860
01:08:37,303 --> 01:08:39,573
- What’s that word?
-  Consistency!

861
01:08:39,574 --> 01:08:40,874
Thanks losers.

862
01:08:41,266 --> 01:08:42,376
Sorry Homer!

863
01:08:43,954 --> 01:08:45,539
I’ll let you hold the bomb.

864
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:48,807
The man knows me.

865
01:08:52,906 --> 01:08:55,252
I wish Homer was my father.

866
01:08:55,453 --> 01:08:57,901
Well, I wish you didn’t have
the devil’s curly hair.

867
01:09:05,973 --> 01:09:09,815
I’ve been taking your crap all my life!

868
01:09:13,044 --> 01:09:15,751
Oh. This feels good.
No wonder you do it.

869
01:09:20,373 --> 01:09:23,439
Ok, Bart. You’ve only got one shot to
throw that bomb through the hole!


870
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:28,851
Dad, in case I miss, I’m sorry I said
I wish you weren’t my father.

871
01:09:29,072 --> 01:09:32,021
I don’t blame you son.
I wasn’t much of a father.

872
01:09:32,255 --> 01:09:34,386
Maybe it started with the
way my dad raised me.

873
01:09:34,874 --> 01:09:36,794
Yes, its clear to me.

874
01:09:37,077 --> 01:09:42,036
- Its just been one long and broken cycle..
- Somebody throw the goddamn bomb!

875
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:04,926
What..
What’s going on?

876
01:10:18,503 --> 01:10:20,167
No, No, No, No!

877
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:31,014
- We did it boy!
- Ah, Dad?

878
01:11:20,149 --> 01:11:21,945
It's amazing no one was hurt.

879
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:25,574
Bye, everybody.

880
01:11:28,335 --> 01:11:31,536
Now, that was a great
father-son activity.

881
01:11:31,914 --> 01:11:33,437
Hello, Homer.

882
01:11:34,717 --> 01:11:38,344
So, we meet at last.
Whoever you are.

883
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:41,349
There’s a couple of things they don’t
teach you out at "Harvard" business school.

884
01:11:41,445 --> 01:11:44,319
One is how to cope with defeat.
The other is how to handle a shotgun.

885
01:11:44,486 --> 01:11:46,910
I’m going to do both right now.

886
01:11:47,081 --> 01:11:51,513
Wait! If you kill my dad, you’ll never
know where the treasure is buried.

887
01:11:52,085 --> 01:11:53,283
What treasure?

888
01:11:54,377 --> 01:11:55,950
The treasure of "Ima Wiener".

889
01:11:56,046 --> 01:11:57,407
"Ima Wiener"?

890
01:11:59,017 --> 01:12:02,089
- Classic.
- Well, always leave`em laughing.

891
01:12:02,463 --> 01:12:03,732
Goodbye Sir.

892
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:15,216
Maggie! What a great little
accident you turned out to be.

893
01:12:18,072 --> 01:12:20,769
Colin? Colin!

894
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:24,048
Lisa, Colin’s dead.

895
01:12:25,241 --> 01:12:30,597
But, his last words were,
"Millhouse, take care of Lisa."

896
01:12:30,785 --> 01:12:32,442
"Hold her hand".

897
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,911
I got her all warmed up for ya.

898
01:12:38,311 --> 01:12:39,067
Colin!

899
01:12:39,874 --> 01:12:40,574
Hi.

900
01:12:40,575 --> 01:12:42,875
- Hey, You wanna go..
- Clean up the lake!

901
01:12:42,936 --> 01:12:45,838
Well, I was gonna say
get some ice cream, but ok.

902
01:12:46,569 --> 01:12:48,037
I like ice cream.

903
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:55,943
Kinda sweaty sorry.

904
01:13:10,267 --> 01:13:12,939
Boy, you survived!
How?

905
01:13:17,491 --> 01:13:18,721
I love you too.

906
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:35,633
Best kiss of my life.

907
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:38,703
Best kiss of your life, so far..

908
01:13:57,222 --> 01:14:00,623
Steady.. steady..

909
01:14:02,363 --> 01:14:03,807
steady...

910
01:14:04,466 --> 01:14:05,716
Ah, dad.

911
01:14:07,069 --> 01:14:08,276
Thanks, boy.

912
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:10,481
Steady...

913
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:31,082

914
01:14:56,089 --> 01:14:57,947
They have taken everything sir.

915
01:15:01,348 --> 01:15:07,648
Smithers, I don’t believe in suicide, but if you’d
like to try, it might cheer me up to watch.

916
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:45,065
This is Tom Hanks saying, if you see me
in person, please leave me be.

917
01:16:55,214 --> 01:16:59,122
Come on dad, Lets go! I’ve been holding it
since they put the dome over the town.

918
01:16:59,123 --> 01:17:05,476
You can wait. A lot of people work really hard on this
film and all they ask is for you to memorize their names.

919
01:17:05,477 --> 01:17:10,993
Well, I wanna make sure no animals were
harmed during the filming of this movie.

920
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:15,200
Ok.

921
01:17:16,001 --> 01:17:18,589
Whoo, floor popcorn!

922
01:17:21,314 --> 01:17:23,999
Wait, Wait, Wait. It looks like
Maggie has something to say.

923
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,931
Oh my God! Her first word!

924
01:17:27,732 --> 01:17:28,932
Sequel?
