00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,407
Orinoco River

2
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,250
Come this way.

3
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,416
Why? Not this way. No, No, No

4
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,002
Where are we?

5
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:53,291
There is not much. It is getting late.
Let's go!

6
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:10,600
- Where you going?
- Come on.

7
00:01:28,126 --> 00:01:29,785
Come in the water.

8
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,760
Stop that nonsense.
I jump in now.

9
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,472
Take it easy.

10
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,557
Orinoco River

11
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,468
Arnold Regis, the U.S. ambassador.

12
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,472
Serjio Cordoba,
Venezuela's Foreign Minister.

13
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,600
We are not a communist country.

14
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:50,522
- If you're thinking...
- I do not think of communism.

15
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:57,320
I'm concerned about the trade agreement
and Washington's sanctions against you.

16
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,906
- Is it a threat?
- A fact.

17
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,910
I thought we would see the sunrise,
this is boring.

18
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,415
I want more champagne
Where is he cute?

19
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,002
Let's not talk politics.

20
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,144
Can you hear anything?

21
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,446
Oh God, who makes it
against an alligator?

22
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:09,684
What the hell is happening?
What the hell is that?

23
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,119
Bob Grady, U.S. Secretary of State

24
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,292
Jason Fitch, Special Forces

25
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:22,382
<i> Ambassador Arnold Regis and a </ i> <br / > <i> Venezuelan diplomat was killed. </ i>

26
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,971
<i> Someone blew up their boat, </ i>
<i> You must go to the Orinoco river now. </ i>

27
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:34,477
Colonel Antonio Diaz leader
investigation from Puerto Ayacucho.

28
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:40,108
<i> He thinks it's terrorists. CIA </ i>
<i> think it is an anti-American coup. </ I>

29
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:47,115
<i> Examine the wreckage before we are faced with a </ i> < br /> <i> new Afghanistan. Do what is necessary. </ I>

30
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:51,119
- <i> And Fitch, good luck. </ I>
- Thank you, sir.

31
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,312
We are close.

32
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,150
Very close.

33
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,944
Sarah Monroe, geneticist.

34
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,532
Dr. Eli Gordon, a biologist.

35
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,704
Monroe, see.

36
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,128
We need a piece
with the laboratory.

37
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,142
The chemical analysis from the boat
is identical with the mutation L-23.

38
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,645
Brian Higgins, a microbiologist.

39
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:03,608
diameter is considerably larger than an ordinary
jaw.

40
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,569
- How much bigger?
- Four times.

41
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,947
That must be them.
They grow obviously larger.

42
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:20,500
No, if the numbers of votes they grow
itself twice every 36th hour.

43
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:28,925
- Try to get a DNA sample from the wreck.
- We may contact Colonel Diaz.

44
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:38,976
- All river traffic must be stopped.
- I've said it, he will not hear.

45
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:44,023
- He just wants to keep people from the jungle.
- And you know why.

46
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:49,695
If the laboratory must be kept going,
you must keep your theories to yourself.

47
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,868
- When when piranhas new size.
- About 24 hours?

48
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,788
- Last.
- So we must stop them before.

49
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,961
airport

50
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,190
Jason Fitch, the State Department.

51
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,402
Sargento Ayudante, Lieutenant

52
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,949
Sargento Vasco Ayudante.
Welcome to the Republic of Venezuela.

53
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,327
Hello, I will meet Antonio Diaz.

54
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:43,874
- Colonel Diaz awaits you came.
- As you want, boss.

55
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,464
- Come on, the car is over here.
- You are from the State Department, right?

56
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,925
Regarding the boat this morning?

57
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:57,597
Wait, I'm Sarah Monroe,
professor of genetics from UCLA.

58
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:03,561
I've worked here the last two years
with a hydro-biological experiment.

59
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:07,898
- Hydro Biology? What is it with...
- We increase the local food supply.

60
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,735
mobile number. Genetic manipulation of fish.

61
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:17,950
- I took care of piranhas.
- I do not have time, I shall meet...

62
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,037
Colonel Diaz, yes, listen to me.

63
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:27,168
One of my test groups, L-23, a special
bloodthirsty and large type

64
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:32,673
- which I named Seracelmus Gigantis
became uncontrollable and was eliminated.

65
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:39,472
I think they have been stolen or is
refuge and breeding in the wild.

66
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,641
- Give Fredningsstyrelsen message.
- No.

67
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:47,605
They ate up the people and their boat,
and we do not act within a day-

68
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:51,567
- grows and grows the
and wipes out everything on their path.

69
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,699
Diaz thinks I'm crazy.

70
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:03,287
Here, take my card.
Come to the lab and see.

71
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:08,542
It is a piece of the hull,
maybe you can convince Diaz.

72
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,881
Good.

73
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,969
Beware, he is a single track,
paranoid bastard.

74
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,015
Come. We come too late.

75
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,168
military headquarters

76
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,947
Colonel Diaz's office is over there.
Follow me.

77
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:25,452
weapons to China are good
we do not need the U.S. anymore.

78
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,415
Welcome to Amazon.

79
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,085
Colonel Antonio Diaz,
junta commander.

80
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:39,466
condolences on behalf of my nation-

81
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:44,972
- and can assure you that the guilty
will be brought to justice.

82
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:50,144
- I've booked a room at the base.
- I planned to stay at the hotel.

83
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:55,316
nonsense, so here I know exactly
where you are.

84
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:11,582
is not ballistics, but there is
no traces of carbon, sulfur, or heat.

85
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,628
where the wood is not torn,
have small ribbed brands.

86
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,465
hinted someone
that the boat was attacked by animals?

87
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:23,969
Animals? Do you see alligators?

88
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:26,597
Or a group of animals.

89
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:35,230
So it was her
you spoke with at the airport.

90
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,360
crazy American researcher.

91
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,446
She has nothing to do with it.

92
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:50,537
She just wants money.
Rifles are made after the explosion-

93
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,375
- of sun perch, which gnawed at the carbon.

94
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:58,629
I have to immediately dive into the river,
I promised Foreign Minister.

95
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:07,137
- And him you will surely not disappoint?
- No.

96
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:15,187
- You will be immediately flown out there.
- Lead.

97
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:29,284
We approach instead of the boat
last radio message.

98
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:36,917
Orinoco river is very primitive.

99
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,922
A place with violence and death,
señor Fitch.

100
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:47,136
- When we land?
- We land not, this is the jungle.

101
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:57,604
- There is nowhere to land here.
- Why the hell we fly then?

102
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:03,360
I have to dive and explore
whether it is an explosion or animals.

103
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:09,825
It was an explosion. The area is cordoned off
, should anything happen, I do.

104
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:14,204
- My country must have an answer, Colonel.
- What about my country?

105
00:15:14,454 --> 00:15:20,586
Americans come and treat us
as a third world country.

106
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:27,092
We are not children, señor Fitch.
It can greet Grady and say.

107
00:15:28,176 --> 00:15:30,387
We fly back!

108
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:55,245
<i> Anti-American demonstrations </ i>
<i> sown in Caracas streets during the day </ i>

109
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:58,665
- <i> after the murder of Arnold Regis. </ i>

<i> No one has claimed responsibility </ i>
<i> for the attack. </ i>

112
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,675
Fuck you!

113
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:19,996
- Can you sail up the river?
- Yes, I know where it is.

114
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:23,333
Come.

115
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:47,816
What happens there? They pulled me out
of a meeting, Diaz will have you removed.

116
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:51,444
He is sinister,
but it has nothing to do with the boat.

117
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:56,533
may be a mine
or an animal attack.

118
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:59,536
- Alligators or fish.
- Fish?

119
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:03,748
, fish, an American researcher
argue it is Piranha.

120
00:18:04,457 --> 00:18:08,795
- You continue, but send a report.
- Yes, sir.

121
00:18:09,045 --> 00:18:12,549
says Diaz,
I can not get you out before tomorrow.

122
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:18,096
- Thank you, sir.
- You have very little time getting started.

123
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:28,732
If I'm not back
about 20 minutes, you call, no...

124
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:35,488
Here, about 20 minutes,
ring to the woman here.

125
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,763
Orinoco Delta </ ??p>

126
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,560
What the hell...

127
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:25,533
Foreign Grady? It was neither
an explosion or terrorist.

128
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,329
It was huge piranha.

129
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:34,375
Yes, sir, giant piranhas, I know.

130
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:39,797
I will.
I will keep you informed, thank you, sir.

131
00:21:53,394 --> 00:21:57,482
- Can they get a boat to disappear?
- What the hell is that?

132
00:21:57,732 --> 00:22:03,071
GM piranhas, your
terrorists. There is a shoal in the Delta.

133
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:05,281
bådvrag everywhere.

134
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:10,036
Are these human beings?

135
00:22:10,286 --> 00:22:14,958
An experiment went wrong.
Now we must figure out how to destroy them.

136
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,252
. These are the exact coordinates.

137
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:22,632
Latitude, 548 degrees north.
Longitude, 67 degrees west.

138
00:22:23,424 --> 00:22:28,471
I take the fish to the crazy
researcher, she helped to create them.

139
00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:35,144
Maybe she knows how to eradicate
them and if Grady did not say it-

140
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,397
- I travel not today.

141
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,274
Have a good day.

142
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:53,788
Knock, knock...
I have a gift for you.

143
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,708
Just what we need.

144
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:05,508
It's incredible, Gordon,
give me an estimate on the size.

145
00:23:05,758 --> 00:23:08,761
- We must look at migration patterns.
- Yes.

146
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:13,224
- Are there more left?
- Yes, perhaps hundreds, they were caught.

147
00:23:13,474 --> 00:23:16,477
- Trapped by what?
- I took a picture.

148
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,566
There is a natural dam,
which bars them from the rest of the river

149
00:23:21,816 --> 00:23:25,111
It's good, really good.

150
00:23:25,653 --> 00:23:28,448
But when they grow,
swim through.

151
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:35,204
- Let's give them a shock.
- It's too dangerous, it can give...

152
00:23:35,621 --> 00:23:39,125
- Reproduction and new mutations.
- Growth.

153
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:43,129
- All sorts of things.
- What about the poison or acid?

154
00:23:43,379 --> 00:23:48,551
No, there is only one resort
we must strengthen the dam with concrete.

155
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:53,973
draining our area
as L-23, Seracelmus Gigantus-

156
00:23:54,557 --> 00:23:56,851
- suffocate.

157
00:23:57,101 --> 00:24:01,731
Otherwise we bombard them with more
weapons than we have here, see it here.

158
00:24:01,981 --> 00:24:06,277
specimen here has at least a dozen
new bodies. Two hearts-

159
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:10,656
- triple thickness,
and it is a hermaphrodite.

160
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,456
- Fitch.
- You must immediately return to base.

161
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:23,127
Diaz has something up his sleeve,
we know not what, but it's big.

162
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:28,424
is underway, researchers have shown a
way to eradicate piranhas on.

163
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,552
Find out what's happening
and report back.

164
00:24:31,802 --> 00:24:34,472
- I have the data you asked for.
- Watch.

165
00:24:34,722 --> 00:24:39,810
There are piranhas in a place
but they migrate to other rivers,

166
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:44,857
- we get this picture
after 12 hours, 24 hours.

167
00:24:45,107 --> 00:24:50,071
36 hours.
About 48 hours after the Mississippi.

168
00:24:54,033 --> 00:24:56,452
- I walk.
- Fitch.

169
00:24:56,953 --> 00:25:00,456
- What?
- Get Diaz to reinforce the dam.

170
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:05,086
- This will be done tonight, before they grow.
- I'm going with, we take my car.

171
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,015
Follow me and be quiet.

172
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:22,269
- Colonel Diaz will see you.
- I'll also talk to him.

173
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,816
- Who is the woman?
- A key U.S. diplomat.

174
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:31,404
- Well, come.
- It was not wise.

175
00:25:32,488 --> 00:25:36,617
<i> All pilots to their positions. </ I>
<i> Operation L-23 has the green light. </ I>

176
00:25:38,285 --> 00:25:41,539
<i > I repeat: </ i>
<i> All pilots to their positions. </ i>

177
00:25:48,504 --> 00:25:51,424
Colonel, I must speak with you.

178
00:25:53,342 --> 00:25:56,804
- Who is she?
- Researchers from UNESCO I talked about.

179
00:25:57,054 --> 00:26:01,100
- We have spoken on the phone.
- Well, it was you.

180
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,478
Take the harness on,
it becomes a rystetur.

181
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,039
- Where are we going?
- For the sealed-off cove.

182
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:28,419
You convinced me.
It was just the proof I needed.

183
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,177
- You're not bombing them?
- Of course, I am a soldier.

184
00:26:40,347 --> 00:26:44,643
- We must strengthen the wall and the empty bay.
- It's no time for.

185
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,231
beats them to death.
This comes to an end tonight.

186
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,985
helicopters do not have enough firepower.

187
00:26:54,111 --> 00:26:58,908
Give me 15 hours, then I get a
destroyer that can do away with them.

188
00:27:03,037 --> 00:27:05,664
- Get ready.
- Ready for ildgivning.

189
00:27:06,332 --> 00:27:08,375
Shoot!

190
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,762
Shoot!

191
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:30,022
- It seems that the missiles kill them.
- It works!

192
00:27:30,272 --> 00:27:33,317
Get the rest of the helicopters in the air now.

193
00:27:36,153 --> 00:27:38,697
Fire the rest of the missiles.

194
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:55,839
You can not do it here!

195
00:27:56,048 --> 00:27:58,300
Shoot!

196
00:28:32,668 --> 00:28:36,171
Congratulations, Fitch.
The case was gnawing at me really.

197
00:28:36,422 --> 00:28:41,552
data show a large number of victims along
rivers, if they were not wiped out.

198
00:28:41,802 --> 00:28:48,017
, Diaz put the area under quarantine,
but Monroe people are there now.

199
00:28:48,267 --> 00:28:52,396
- They make sure we got them all.
- Well, we close the case.

200
00:28:52,604 --> 00:28:57,985
Venezuela are not happy, they talk
to arrest everyone from the lab.

201
00:28:58,235 --> 00:29:02,698
- It's madness, they tried to help.
- I know, I do what I can.

202
00:29:02,948 --> 00:29:08,912
fly to Caracas tonight
to soften the bad conditions.

203
00:29:09,163 --> 00:29:15,711
Hold Diaz happy, we are hopefully
both on the way home tomorrow evening.

204
00:29:15,961 --> 00:29:18,839
I hope
I will do my best.

205
00:29:24,136 --> 00:29:27,389
- Do you remember?
- I had plenty of wealthy women.

206
00:29:30,642 --> 00:29:34,313
Señor Jason Fitch, take a drink.

207
00:29:34,521 --> 00:29:37,733
Bowl.

208
00:29:38,442 --> 00:29:43,906
I hope you had a good time here.
I hear you leaving tomorrow?

209
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:48,452
if Grady is satisfied
I travel more than happy.

210
00:29:48,702 --> 00:29:53,415
- Where is your little friend?
- She comes in a moment.

211
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:58,587
Is she tired of her small creatures
is dead?

212
00:30:00,214 --> 00:30:02,174
I hardly think so.

213
00:30:02,716 --> 00:30:07,763
Been in her lab?
I would like to see it.

214
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:13,268
- There is not much to see.
- Oh so you like her.

215
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:17,439
But maybe she started
with other things that can go wrong.

216
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,572
- Take your equipment!
- We need to Unesco's laboratory.

217
00:30:41,296 --> 00:30:44,925
- Is your work here help?
- Yes, certainly.

218
00:30:45,175 --> 00:30:48,971
Our project feeding 30%
of its population.

219
00:30:49,471 --> 00:30:54,685
Successful projects?
What about failures?

220
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:58,105
There has been only one.

221
00:31:01,733 --> 00:31:07,197
- Scientists are trying to help.
- UN supports us.

222
00:31:09,157 --> 00:31:14,913
UN? How charitable.

223
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:20,085
- Seize them.
- Take it all, grab them.

224
00:31:20,502 --> 00:31:25,507
These U.S. researchers have conducted experiments
illegal in my country.

225
00:31:25,716 --> 00:31:28,176
Do you understand? My country!

226
00:31:28,635 --> 00:31:33,390
- The laboratory is closed,
- Closed, Fitch. Come.

227
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:38,103
- Turn something for all doors and windows.
- Take my car and drive.

228
00:31:38,353 --> 00:31:41,606
- I'm not running from you.
- And if you're arrested? Run.

229
00:31:41,857 --> 00:31:44,860
You can not do it here!

230
00:31:45,068 --> 00:31:48,572
- Arrest her!
- You're under arrest!

231
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,907
with Fitch.

232
00:32:07,632 --> 00:32:13,847
I have collected 46 dead L-23.
They have been far from all.

233
00:32:14,473 --> 00:32:18,643
only 35, you're right,
they were far from them all.

234
00:32:19,978 --> 00:32:25,275
I must away from here,
Diaz both are on the way.

235
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:30,530
Higgins? Damn.

236
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:35,035
I see something over there.
Careful.

237
00:33:04,856 --> 00:33:08,193
- It looks as if here is something.
- There, Captain.

238
00:34:24,853 --> 00:34:27,856
- Sorry.
- You did it.

239
00:34:28,106 --> 00:34:31,985
- You scared me to death.
- Diaz has been chasing me all night.

240
00:34:32,235 --> 00:34:35,947
I think I shook them off.
- How does the dam?

241
00:34:36,197 --> 00:34:39,951
is blown to pieces,
nothing keeps them more.

242
00:34:41,661 --> 00:34:46,833
Clearly, they escaped. Diaz spent
grenades and machine guns against them.

243
00:34:47,042 --> 00:34:50,045
We need a massive attack.

244
00:34:50,295 --> 00:34:52,464
Come.

245
00:35:07,228 --> 00:35:13,276
- Stop! Go!
- Take it easy.

246
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:17,113
- Go!
- Yes, we have enough.

247
00:35:21,618 --> 00:35:24,496
I must help him.

248
00:35:33,463 --> 00:35:35,465
You can do nothing.

249
00:36:04,077 --> 00:36:06,121
Pis.

250
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,374
Stop.

251
00:36:25,056 --> 00:36:27,684
Nothing new,
they are still there.

252
00:36:27,892 --> 00:36:32,397
Reports moves Diaz
them to an unknown place.

253
00:36:32,564 --> 00:36:37,944
Lose them, what a mess.
And the fish are still out there.

254
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:44,117
- Did you hear about the attack last night?
- Yes, sir. 20 men, a whole gunboat.

255
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:50,331
Diaz argue it is the CIA, who plans
to take over the country. Caracas agrees.

256
00:36:50,582 --> 00:36:55,295
negotiate with them
950 km north of Aruba.

257
00:36:55,503 --> 00:37:01,467
Protect the researchers
otherwise we do not get to grips with the fish.

258
00:37:02,218 --> 00:37:05,430
Yes, sir. I will do my best.

259
00:37:28,328 --> 00:37:30,371
What do you think?

260
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:34,959
three have conducted illegal
-science experiments

261
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:39,172
- and fictional stories about me
to carry out a coup.

262
00:37:39,422 --> 00:37:42,175
It's ridiculous.

263
00:37:45,011 --> 00:37:49,432
Believe me when I arrive
to Guyana Prison district

264
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:54,103
- everything becomes much worse.

265
00:37:54,312 --> 00:38:00,234
Listen, I will blow on you
doing, or you're from the cartel...

266
00:38:00,485 --> 00:38:05,740
sign!
Signatories, admit you are from the CIA

267
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:09,494
- and all your colleagues are.

268
00:38:09,744 --> 00:38:15,124
You do not get it.
We must stay and kill Piranha

269
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:18,586
- before they become so large
that nothing can stop them.

270
00:38:43,611 --> 00:38:46,656
Come on!

271
00:39:04,549 --> 00:39:07,051
Oh God, what have they done?

272
00:39:09,137 --> 00:39:11,430
I'll make it.

273
00:39:41,878 --> 00:39:45,214
- What the hell is going on here?
- I do not know.

274
00:39:52,513 --> 00:39:55,099
Kill them if they touch themselves.

275
00:39:57,852 --> 00:40:02,064
Stay there, do not move!
Touch you, you're dead! Come on.

276
00:40:38,684 --> 00:40:44,273
Come on, the car is there. I get you
to the American Embassy.

277
00:40:45,149 --> 00:40:47,109
Ind.

278
00:40:52,782 --> 00:40:56,827
- This is the port.
- We must go there. Come on.

279
00:40:57,078 --> 00:40:59,080
Hurry!

280
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:04,919
Hurry! My goodness!

281
00:41:07,963 --> 00:41:11,092
Come, let us get away.

282
00:41:14,553 --> 00:41:16,806
Come on!

283
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:42,665
Seracelmus has increased.

284
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:02,309
piranhas go to sea,
perhaps we can catch them.

285
00:42:02,476 --> 00:42:07,273
- Go that way, I take some samples.
- Be careful.

286
00:42:34,508 --> 00:42:37,344
- What is it?
- Register shoals.

287
00:42:38,179 --> 00:42:42,391
- The art keeps moving.
- Why are there so many left?

288
00:42:42,808 --> 00:42:47,771
They are only pregnant for six hours,
they absorb nutrition-

289
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:52,902
- so they grow and increase in number,
as if they only consisted of stem cells.

290
00:42:55,946 --> 00:42:57,907
Stay here.

291
00:42:58,157 --> 00:43:03,078
quiet, you can do it, relax.

292
00:43:21,847 --> 00:43:23,974
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

293
00:43:24,808 --> 00:43:28,437
I checked it three times,
going north towards the sea.

294
00:43:28,646 --> 00:43:31,815
- It helps us.
- We must warn seaside towns.

295
00:43:32,024 --> 00:43:35,486
Piranha are freshwater fish,
they avoid saltwater.

296
00:43:35,694 --> 00:43:39,490
Once they reach the estuary, salt water
will act as a wall.

297
00:43:39,698 --> 00:43:43,953
- Well, we know where to strike.
- This time they did not escape.

298
00:43:46,372 --> 00:43:51,502
No, he's dead, I'll get you
to the embassy, ??come on.

299
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:55,714
not to the embassy.
We must follow them down the river.

300
00:43:55,923 --> 00:43:59,635
Find them, kill them, bomb them.
I kill them!

301
00:44:00,511 --> 00:44:03,472
- There they are, grab them!
- Hurry!

302
00:44:04,098 --> 00:44:06,350
Señor Fitch, stop!

303
00:44:07,226 --> 00:44:09,144
Come!

304
00:44:23,117 --> 00:44:30,749
viewing figures from those
who escaped, the one we got and the one we saw.

305
00:44:30,999 --> 00:44:35,963
doubled in size,
in half the time we estimated.

306
00:44:36,213 --> 00:44:39,842
- Plus one more time in each cycle.
- Explain yourself.

307
00:44:40,092 --> 00:44:45,180
They are like horses at the estuary
and rhinos six hours later.

308
00:44:45,431 --> 00:44:51,854
4 hours later, an elephant.
So, like whales, they can go on.

309
00:44:53,397 --> 00:44:56,400
I.S.B. INTERNATIONAL
SUPER BUNKER

310
00:45:05,868 --> 00:45:10,414
Foreign Grady.
- What the hell happens Fitch?

311
00:45:10,622 --> 00:45:15,836
We just witnessed an attack.
Harbor was destroyed, Higgins died.

312
00:45:16,086 --> 00:45:20,215
- Say what you want, you get it.
- Orinicos mouth of the bombing.

313
00:45:20,466 --> 00:45:25,554
where freshwater and saltwater meet.
Piranha are there in a few hours.

314
00:45:25,804 --> 00:45:29,224
Bomb estuary? Are you crazy?

315
00:45:29,475 --> 00:45:35,105
Venezuela is a sovereign state, and our
diplomatic relations are bad.

316
00:45:35,355 --> 00:45:42,905
Turns we do not now, they will grow
proliferate and lay across desolate coast.

317
00:45:43,155 --> 00:45:49,870
- It's our only chance.
- I'll send the address to a satellite.

318
00:45:52,164 --> 00:45:57,211
- I have a GPS.
- I will also send an observation ship.

319
00:45:57,669 --> 00:46:04,718
09:50 send an SOS. The ship comes to the rescue
outside their border.

320
00:46:04,968 --> 00:46:08,180
So we avoid possibly third World War II.

321
00:46:08,722 --> 00:46:11,308
Yes, sir.
About one hour and fifteen minutes.

322
00:46:11,516 --> 00:46:15,520
Fitch, ships passing just over,
they are not waiting for you.

323
00:46:15,771 --> 00:46:20,901
SOS call to come exactly 9:50,
otherwise closes the window.

324
00:46:23,695 --> 00:46:26,823
- How far is the coast?
- Two hours.

325
00:46:27,407 --> 00:46:30,661
be done much faster.
Hold.

326
00:46:42,506 --> 00:46:47,260
- Is it a police check?
- We do not have time, hiding you.

327
00:46:57,604 --> 00:46:59,856
Makes you invisible.

328
00:47:03,151 --> 00:47:05,570
papers.

329
00:47:09,157 --> 00:47:11,243
papers.

330
00:47:15,747 --> 00:47:17,916
We are being persecuted.

331
00:47:18,166 --> 00:47:21,670
- Where?
- Six o'clock. Behind us.

332
00:47:28,009 --> 00:47:32,305
- There they are.
- The helicopter gets them.

333
00:47:36,435 --> 00:47:40,147
A helicopter is airborne.
We get an image in 20 seconds.

334
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:53,535
- I knew that Fitch was a spy.
- Fitch is irrelevant now.

335
00:47:54,244 --> 00:47:58,039
Professor Monroe
and the others, I'm looking for.

336
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:01,877
We get them, Colonel, I promise.

337
00:48:06,631 --> 00:48:09,092
I know the car. It is Diaz.

338
00:48:11,511 --> 00:48:13,472
Hold.

339
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:30,155
I.S.B. SUPER BUNKER,
Command Center

340
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:35,535
USS St Harper is sliding distance
from the estuary about 36 minutes.

341
00:48:38,622 --> 00:48:41,249
Come Fitch.

342
00:48:45,295 --> 00:48:47,547
Hold on!

343
00:49:11,029 --> 00:49:13,657
- Turn!
- Yes, if your car could.

344
00:49:17,369 --> 00:49:20,497
I try to shake them off in town,
hold you down.

345
00:49:50,735 --> 00:49:53,029
Now it's real.

346
00:51:02,098 --> 00:51:05,101
I think I shook them off.

347
00:51:22,494 --> 00:51:26,247
Step out of the car. You too, Fitch.

348
00:51:33,254 --> 00:51:36,549
Come out with your hands up,
otherwise we shoot.

349
00:51:36,758 --> 00:51:42,263
makes you nothing
I just need to clear our names.

350
00:51:57,695 --> 00:51:59,906
Come this way.

351
00:52:17,423 --> 00:52:21,511
USS St Harper
off the coast of Venezuela

352
00:52:24,514 --> 00:52:26,849
We are shooting distance.

353
00:52:27,058 --> 00:52:30,144
- Is SOS'en come?
- Not yet, sir.

354
00:52:31,854 --> 00:52:34,649
- How much time do we have?
- One minute.

355
00:52:39,237 --> 00:52:42,031
- Piranha is not here.
- They come.

356
00:52:43,449 --> 00:52:45,994
Back.
I order an attack.

357
00:52:51,457 --> 00:52:54,210
There they are.

358
00:52:56,838 --> 00:52:59,048
Back.

359
00:53:02,343 --> 00:53:06,306
- They caught only a few minutes.
- It is now that they are attacked.

360
00:53:06,514 --> 00:53:09,309
tests, the battery is nearly empty.

361
00:53:12,061 --> 00:53:16,357
45 seconds, Captain. They are lost,
if the call is not coming soon.

362
00:53:26,909 --> 00:53:29,495
SOS... Battery is dead.

363
00:53:29,704 --> 00:53:33,374
Candy on battery
acid in your saliva gives you 10%...

364
00:54:07,617 --> 00:54:09,786
makes you nothing.

365
00:54:12,205 --> 00:54:14,957
to help stop the killings.

366
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:20,838
I.S.B. INTERNATIONAL
SUPER BUNKER

367
00:54:26,344 --> 00:54:28,888
Come Fitch. Where the hell are you?

368
00:54:31,307 --> 00:54:33,726
- How long?
- 20 seconds.

369
00:54:36,187 --> 00:54:40,775
must cleanse our names
we work together to help people.

370
00:54:42,985 --> 00:54:47,198
surrender in you not, I am forced
to shoot you down as spies.

371
00:54:47,949 --> 00:54:51,452
Come forth,
or we shoot you, you bastard!

372
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,595
- five seconds.
- Now.

373
00:55:16,852 --> 00:55:19,438
They went that way, come!

374
00:55:23,776 --> 00:55:28,573
SOS, we are under attack by
estuary, we must have help.

375
00:55:28,781 --> 00:55:33,828
- Green Light!
- USS St Harper, you have the green light.

376
00:55:35,204 --> 00:55:37,707
- SOS'en has come.
- Shoot!

377
00:55:37,915 --> 00:55:42,253
Can you see the mouth? Salt water works
approaching not, I must see.

378
00:55:42,878 --> 00:55:45,339
Fire forward cannon.

379
00:55:57,184 --> 00:55:59,270
Down!

380
00:56:25,296 --> 00:56:27,423
something happened to you?

381
00:56:30,301 --> 00:56:32,803
Come, let's go.

382
00:56:42,396 --> 00:56:45,733
- Are they all dead?
- I check the water.

383
00:56:59,705 --> 00:57:03,751
Not a sound, it does not detect
a piranha here or up the river.

384
00:57:05,169 --> 00:57:08,464
I think they killed them.

385
00:57:13,094 --> 00:57:17,139
I hate to interrupt,
but Diaz is still after us.

386
00:57:17,389 --> 00:57:19,850
Between the trees here.

387
00:57:27,483 --> 00:57:31,570
They move toward the beach,
send two helicopters and fetch them.

388
00:57:33,155 --> 00:57:38,327
We move along the coast,
they can evacuate us from there.

389
00:57:38,536 --> 00:57:41,455
...

390
00:57:50,506 --> 00:57:53,342
Oh no...

391
00:57:57,638 --> 00:58:00,808
Can they live in the ocean?

392
00:58:17,575 --> 00:58:19,660
What the hell is that?

393
00:58:28,377 --> 00:58:34,341
Full power reverse.
Make torpedoes ready.

394
00:58:36,468 --> 00:58:39,096
Fire the torpedoes!

395
00:58:58,032 --> 00:59:01,910
Get ready to abandon ship.

396
00:59:19,553 --> 00:59:23,932
USS St Harper is crushed.
Piranha moves out to sea.

397
00:59:26,226 --> 00:59:28,520
God help us all.

398
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:39,031
They continue to grow,
and we can do nothing.

399
00:59:40,699 --> 00:59:43,869
We can not do anything.

400
00:59:45,287 --> 00:59:50,709
- We can do nothing...
- You're the only ones who can stop them.

401
00:59:51,668 --> 00:59:54,296
Handles you? Come.

402
00:59:55,172 --> 00:59:59,551
with Gordon came.
Wait here.

403
01:00:00,302 --> 01:00:03,305
- What do you want?
- I'll get a helicopter.

404
01:00:03,514 --> 01:00:06,350
Stay down.

405
01:00:21,824 --> 01:00:24,368
To helicopter.

406
01:00:28,831 --> 01:00:31,083
Hurry.

407
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:39,341
- I thought you could fly them.
- Yes, but everyone is different.

408
01:00:39,508 --> 01:00:44,471
- Get them in the air.
- Come on, hurry up!

409
01:01:06,618 --> 01:01:09,121
I think they persecute us.

410
01:01:22,718 --> 01:01:27,472
- There they are on their way towards the sea.
- They can live in salt water, is there more?

411
01:01:27,723 --> 01:01:31,018
- They do not sleep, and they have three stomachs...
- Hold on!

412
01:01:42,821 --> 01:01:46,783
- Would they not want us alive?
- Things are changing.

413
01:01:56,293 --> 01:01:59,463
- Come on.
- Turn!

414
01:02:27,824 --> 01:02:30,035
missile on its way!

415
01:02:45,592 --> 01:02:47,969
Shoot him down!

416
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:04,403
- Diaz flies westward.
- We have bigger problems than him.

417
01:03:04,653 --> 01:03:07,989
- Which way are piranhas?
- East towards the sea.

418
01:03:08,657 --> 01:03:13,453
- As we fly north.
- Why? There is only ocean.

419
01:03:13,662 --> 01:03:17,666
- To be arrested again?
- No, there is a place closer.

420
01:03:17,916 --> 01:03:22,254
addition, we can not reach the coast,
We hit the fuel line leak.

421
01:03:24,714 --> 01:03:28,885
- Maybe I can fix anything.
- It is needed.

422
01:03:29,761 --> 01:03:32,722
There must be a can here.

423
01:03:34,182 --> 01:03:36,643
It sucks to die from running out.

424
01:03:36,893 --> 01:03:39,521
I got you into this mess, let me.

425
01:03:39,771 --> 01:03:41,898
- An oxygen cylinder.
- Yes.

426
01:03:42,149 --> 01:03:46,820
No, it is an internal combustion engine.
It must be able to burn.

427
01:03:48,446 --> 01:03:53,493
- I can get anything to burn.
- Make it fast, because we lose altitude.

428
01:04:06,089 --> 01:04:08,800
To ready for an injection?

429
01:04:16,224 --> 01:04:20,645
- I should work for Nascar.
- It extends only to a few minutes.

430
01:04:22,355 --> 01:04:25,275
Fine, I do not need more.

431
01:04:26,192 --> 01:04:28,737
Look, there it is.

432
01:04:30,614 --> 01:04:34,951
- What is it?
- ISB's base in the West.

433
01:04:35,201 --> 01:04:39,164
Beautiful sight, is not it?
Hold on, we go down.

434
01:04:51,426 --> 01:04:56,473
There are only four in the world, each of them
can house 200,000 in a crisis situation.

435
01:04:56,681 --> 01:05:01,227
- Like what? A nuclear war?
- Yes, and meteorites, volcanoes...

436
01:05:02,145 --> 01:05:04,939
- An ice age.
- Welcome back, sir.

437
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,527
- Are you a big man here?
- No, I'm just an analyst.

438
01:05:11,154 --> 01:05:16,660
We talk to the Minister first.
Reply bluntly on issues.

439
01:05:18,036 --> 01:05:21,122
Consider all here as ordinary
people.

440
01:05:21,581 --> 01:05:24,876
- It's good to see you again, boss.
- Pipes, gentlemen.

441
01:05:28,755 --> 01:05:35,512
While we stand here, grow Seracelmus,
change the direction of the island is in the way.

442
01:05:36,221 --> 01:05:41,976
We are in a fortress, surrounded by
aircraft carriers and cruisers.

443
01:05:42,268 --> 01:05:46,064
- I saw what they do by cruisers.
- We have plenty of firepower.

444
01:05:46,314 --> 01:05:50,443
Not enough and in a few hours to
I spend twice as much as now.

445
01:05:52,112 --> 01:05:57,158
She is right. We must strike
with everything we have.

446
01:05:58,451 --> 01:06:02,455
I agree with Professor Monroe,
she knows the enemy.

447
01:06:04,499 --> 01:06:10,338
Our experts follows the shoal.
They move eastward from the north.

448
01:06:10,797 --> 01:06:16,928
That means they reach Sydflorida
this afternoon, what can we expect?

449
01:06:17,178 --> 01:06:22,559
They are created with one goal in mind,
to create as much protein as possible.

450
01:06:22,851 --> 01:06:26,896
They eat, grow and reproduce,
they never stop.

451
01:06:30,358 --> 01:06:33,862
We'll stop them, but
Greenpeace opposes the way.

452
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:40,160
- What does this mean?
- A nuclear submarine stops them in an hour.

453
01:06:40,785 --> 01:06:45,290
As soon as they are far enough from shore, we
bombs them with 20 Kt.

454
01:06:46,166 --> 01:06:50,628
- It is enough to put the New York desert.
- As a Greenpeace activist...

455
01:06:50,837 --> 01:06:53,006
Would I double it.

456
01:06:53,214 --> 01:06:58,219
- Where are piranhas now?
- The satellites are tracking them.

457
01:07:08,146 --> 01:07:11,274
USS Florida, submarine, Ohio class.

458
01:07:23,036 --> 01:07:25,997
them.
I send it to the screen.

459
01:07:31,794 --> 01:07:34,547
Goodness.

460
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:43,097
They're soon in target distance.

461
01:07:51,856 --> 01:07:53,983
should be larger.

462
01:07:54,233 --> 01:08:01,532
goal is the optimum distance
about ten seconds. 9, 8, 7, 6 ..

463
01:08:01,783 --> 01:08:08,456
... 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 The target is locked.

464
01:08:08,706 --> 01:08:10,875
lighthouse!

465
01:08:40,571 --> 01:08:44,283
- Some signs of life?
- Not yet.

466
01:09:00,425 --> 01:09:02,468
Good heavens!

467
01:09:06,639 --> 01:09:12,311
No, it's impossible.
Get the submarine away from there.

468
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:16,732
Get away from there!
I repeat...

469
01:09:16,983 --> 01:09:18,943
What does he say?

470
01:09:19,193 --> 01:09:23,406
- Do we have a picture?
- No, Captain, sensors get nothing.

471
01:09:23,614 --> 01:09:27,243
- We dive out.
- I have a picture, sir.

472
01:09:27,493 --> 01:09:30,079
Get it up on the screen.

473
01:10:00,651 --> 01:10:03,404
When  when Florida?

474
01:10:04,655 --> 01:10:07,116
In less than an hour.

475
01:10:08,701 --> 01:10:11,370
So when we are not to evacuate.

476
01:10:13,831 --> 01:10:18,044
Give me a line to the president.
I take it in my chamber.

477
01:10:26,344 --> 01:10:28,304
Excuse me.

478
01:10:34,977 --> 01:10:39,357
Foreign Affairs.
What is it?

479
01:10:40,358 --> 01:10:42,443
you not say?

480
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:47,698
green light to order
an attack 100 times larger than before.

481
01:10:48,741 --> 01:10:54,163
Enough to destroy all land
and boil all the water in and around Florida.

482
01:10:54,372 --> 01:10:57,917
They reacted the barely
the last attack.

483
01:11:00,211 --> 01:11:04,131
- The next stop them.
- There must be another way.

484
01:11:04,382 --> 01:11:06,592
Do you have a better idea?

485
01:11:08,052 --> 01:11:14,642
Yes, in Venezuela, I was attacked by some
of about half a meter.

486
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:21,524
I cut one of them with my knife,
because it was bleeding, they attacked the other.

487
01:11:21,774 --> 01:11:27,530
They tore it to pieces. Will we
large to bleed the same way...

488
01:11:27,738 --> 01:11:31,367
How? They do not bleed once
with bombs and missiles.

489
01:11:31,575 --> 01:11:36,664
- An accurate attack, as a surgeon.
- It would take you diving.

490
01:11:36,956 --> 01:11:40,209
- And hit them in the eye.
- Exactly, exactly.

491
01:11:42,128 --> 01:11:46,549
and a group of other divers.
We can do it.

492
01:11:49,301 --> 01:11:52,722
Let me try.
I will not let you.

493
01:11:55,599 --> 01:12:00,730
- But you die, and others.
- It's better than the alternative.

494
01:12:03,649 --> 01:12:05,943
Foreign...

495
01:12:07,737 --> 01:12:09,739
Bob.

496
01:12:11,824 --> 01:12:16,454
Let us try.
Give us one last chance.

497
01:12:21,292 --> 01:12:26,338
Good, Fitch. You get one last chance.

498
01:12:50,696 --> 01:12:55,743
<i> Here is Jane Fisher of the South </ i>

Do you really think of it?
It is such a lovely day.

501
01:13:09,924 --> 01:13:13,219
As if we get hurricane.
The story is a dead duck.

01:14:04,019 --> 01:14:09,066
you meet the fish on an equal footing.
And that's exactly what they are.

511
01:14:10,734 --> 01:14:13,737
They are nothing more than fish.

512
01:14:15,197 --> 01:14:17,241
I have something for you.

01:14:17,825 --> 01:14:21,245

We come so close to the coast attacked

Heat the frying pan, pal.
This one is big enough for three.

540
01:17:02,781 --> 01:17:05,993
Florida detector,
piranhas are promoting.

541
01:17:20,215 --> 01:17:22,926

We are approaching the drop zone.
Last check, take your gear. Speed ??on.

552
01:19:25,674 --> 01:19:28,843
Chef who?

553
01:19:33,473 --> 01:19:37,936

Fitch, stop, get your men out.
I order a nuclear attack.

563
01:20:30,447 --> 01:20:36,286
- No, sir, not in Florida.

01:20:45,545 --> 01:20:51,217
- Fitch, you have two minutes.
- Roger, two minutes.

567
01:20:55,972 --> 01:21:00,602

We cover Fitch and Gordon.

571
01:21:30,381 --> 01:21:34,052
An unidentified helicopter
approaching ours.

572
01:21:38,681 --> 01:21:44,104
- I see it to starboard.
- Fitch came away from there!

573
01:21:44,729 --> 01:21:46,773
He can not hear us.

574
01:21:47,482 --> 01:21:50,026
What are they doing?

575
01:21:52,237 --> 01:21:54,197
Beware!

576
01:22:00,161 --> 01:22:02,997
- Send two helicopters now!
- Yes, sir.

577
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:12,465
first.

- Jason Fitch, are you there?
- There is no contact.

579
01:22:20,849 --> 01:22:24,352
sorry, but I think
we must go to the Emergency Plan.

580
01:22:24,519 --> 01:22:28,273
We must turn to
before they get too far north.

581
01:22:28,481 --> 01:22:32,277
- When will the Washington?
- In less than two hours.

582
01:22:32,485 --> 01:22:36,489
And for them the time they are three times
as large as now.

583
01:22:42,495 --> 01:22:44,831
Above it now!

584
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:53,464
- haunt you? People are dying down there.
- I do not joke.

585
01:23:05,935 --> 01:23:09,480
Gordon! Out!

587
01:23:52,899 --> 01:23:55,026

01:23:57,403 --> 01:24:02,450
- I must stop her.
- Shut up where incredible!

589
01:24:03,493 --> 01:24:06,162
It's good to see you. We get beaten.

590
01:24:06,371 --> 01:24:11,501
I think I can help, wait for my
signal and run after the gills.

591
01:24:24,263 --> 01:24:26,891
Come and get me, you devil.

592
01:24:47,078 --> 01:24:49,122
Now I have you.

593
01:25:23,489 --> 01:25:26,534
We did it.
It is a big feast.

594
01:25:27,535 --> 01:25:29,829
They rip each other to bits.

595
01:25:32,874 --> 01:25:35,918
- Yes!
- Well done!

596
01:25:36,127 --> 01:25:40,965
- We must get away before it's our turn.
- Fitch, I want you up.

597
01:25:41,173 --> 01:25:44,552
send a rescue helicopter
after them.

598
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:50,516
- Roger, we are going up.
- We must rise to the surface.

599
01:25:57,398 --> 01:26:00,443
- Does it, Doctor?
- I've just been shot.

600
01:26:00,610 --> 01:26:04,697
- And you threw me out of a helicopter.
- You will survive.

601
01:27:40,292 --> 01:27:45,464
- Well done by an analyst, Fitch.
