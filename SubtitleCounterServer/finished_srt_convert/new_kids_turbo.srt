1
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,832
That fucking butterfly.

2
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:49,249
So what, dude! It's not my bike.

3
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:51,915
I stole it from that cunt.

4
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,957
That homo on Horzik Street.
The short, cross-eyed one.

5
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,915
Dude, I told him not to ride
on my street.

6
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,249
And what does he do?
He does it anyway.

7
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:04,624
So I see him coming as I'm waiting
in the bushes. Dude, I jump out...

8
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,499
That's my grill, cunt!

9
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,249
It's all bent! Do you know
how much that costs?

10
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,749
It's all good.

11
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,207
I don't feel anything.

12
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,790
I'm doing great!

13
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,207
I'm hungry.

14
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,124
Just as the economy
seemed to be recovering...

15
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,707
...we're looking at yet
another bad forecast.

16
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:47,415
Economists predict a second,
even bigger crisis...

17
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,957
...named 'The Black Hole',
which will mainly affect this region.

18
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,207
Difficult times may be ahead
for the people of Brabant.

19
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:57,249
I'll keep you informed. I'm Peter Vernhout,
reporting from's Hertogenbosch...

20
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,082
Look at this.

21
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,957
Jody Bernal's coming to Maaskantje!

22
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,582
Who would go and see that?

23
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,999
Que si, que no!

24
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,290
Such a homo.

25
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,999
Two grizzly's, noodles,
a fried sausage...

26
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,332
...two Ricky Martins with peanut sauce,
turkey stick, a Sloppy Joe,

27
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,374
...and a sausage roll,
a large order of chicken nuggets...

28
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,582
...and bakpaos.

29
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:31,999
Hey Henk.

30
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,124
You forgot my fried chicken!

31
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:38,249
- You didn't put your order in.
- I did, dude.

32
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,665
- No, you didn't.
- I did.

33
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,040
You mongoloid!

34
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:48,249
Truck driver! Honk, honk.

35
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:54,915
Hey cunt! We're done!

36
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:56,915
We got it.

37
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,415
Take care!

38
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,374
Hey Robbie, can I have one?

39
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,874
Are you kidding me?
I haven't eaten all day, cunt!

40
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,582
Seasoned meat. He likes that.

41
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,832
Stay away from my nuggets, cunt!

42
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,499
Good afternoon gentlemen.
What's going on here?

43
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,374
We're drinking beer.

44
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,957
According to regional law that is
prohibited. So hand over those beers, guys.

45
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,290
No.

46
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:52,124
Come on guys. Give me those beers
or I will have to take you in.

47
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:53,915
Hey dickhead!

48
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,832
- You feel like running?
- Excuse me?

49
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,832
Nice...

50
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,957
...it's the weekend.

51
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:20,290
Bullshit. It's Tuesday, cunt!

52
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,915
No dude, it's Sunday!

53
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,415
Fuck!

54
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,499
Hey! What are you doing?

55
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,249
- What?
- What are you doing?

56
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,165
Can't...

57
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,207
- What?
- Easy dude.

58
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,665
I always lift TV's like that.

59
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,040
No worries, dude. I bet...

60
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:08,832
...it will work when you plug it back in.

61
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,665
- What do you mean 'no worries'?
- No, no, no.

62
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,249
I swear.

63
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,582
I swear to you!

64
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,499
Hey, homo.

65
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,082
What you're going to do is...

66
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,165
You are going home.

67
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,707
And you're not coming back here.

68
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,374
What are you doing here?

69
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,290
Checking up on you guys.

70
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,457
Where are the gardening hoes?

71
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,207
What kind of an ugly thing is that?

72
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,915
That's Gradje!

73
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:02,415
Whatever.
You don't bring it to work, you idiot!

74
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,249
- He ruined that gardening hoe.
- Yeah. So what?

75
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,124
'So what? '

76
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,082
You know what, dude?

77
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,749
You and your fucking dog are fired.

78
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,915
And you too, Robbie.

79
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,749
Don't talk that way about my dog, cunt!

80
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,374
You can stick that job up your ass.

81
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,207
I'll go and get unemployment benefits.

82
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,790
Yeah, you cunt!

83
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,582
Hey, Rikkert!

84
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,999
You're fired, cunt.

85
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:03,499
Hey, Rikkert, just joking.
It's a joke.

86
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,332
Hey, Rikkert!

87
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,665
But you are fired.

88
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,165
I can only keep the best.

89
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:20,290
And I fucked your mother in the ass.
Just so you know.

90
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,832
Now go away, Rikkert.
Get out, Rikkert.

91
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,915
Say hi to your mother.

92
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,957
Headlines: Mass dismisssal
caused by financial crisis

93
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,499
I got fired today too!
Dammit! That fucking crisis!

94
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,874
Anyway, I think you should
start working more.

95
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,457
Are you crazy?

96
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:08,165
I'm already at the grocery store six days
a week. How much more could I work?

97
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,415
I don't know. Seven days?

98
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,999
What have you done in the last three
months that you've been living here?

99
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,540
- I haven't gotten laid. That's for sure.
- What?

100
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,707
What? Am I right?

101
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:27,540
We've been together for thirteen weeks.
And I'm only allowed to use my fingers.

102
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:33,665
What? Am I right?
You will have a finger, but not a cock.

103
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,540
It's not like you're still a virgin.

104
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,582
See? Nothing.
This is not working.

105
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,332
Call me when you're ready to fuck!

106
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,332
Jody Bernal is coming
to Maaskantje

107
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:27,207
- Do I smell poop?
- It's the bakpao he just had.

108
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,832
Can I stay here?
I got into trouble with my hoe.

109
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,499
Hoe!

110
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,415
It's all good, dude.

111
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:25,290
Dammit! That was the best part
of the show.

112
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,040
You are foul-mouthed.

113
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,999
I work, maybe you should too.
Find a new job.

114
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,082
I can't see.

115
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,790
What are you doing?

116
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,999
You are worthless.

117
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,915
You are a weak homo,
just like your father.

118
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,665
That's why he left you.

119
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,499
Dude, what are you doing?

120
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,915
Can I stay with you for a while?

121
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,749
My mom is giving me a hard time,
you know. I'll be good.

122
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,540
You know me.

123
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,790
Get off that couch!
That's my spot, dude.

124
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,874
Nice ottoman, right?

125
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:59,332
We are live at Gerstakker in Maaskantje,
where there's a fire.

126
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,582
After attempting to extinguish
the fire, the firefighters...

127
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,707
...had to let the home burn down.
We have no information on the tenants.

128
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,749
All we know is that there's
a strong cannabis smell.

129
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,374
I will keep you informed.
This is Peter Vernhout...

130
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,040
Awesome! All buds.

131
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,999
You can stay here too.

132
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,624
Sorry.

133
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,915
Watch me! Watch me!

134
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:51,415
I got my unemployment check.
Money for free, dude.

135
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,749
Let's buy stuff!

136
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,040
Hey.

137
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,374
You're not even responding.

138
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,290
Fine. Whatever.

139
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,624
That's 112 euros and 16 cents.

140
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,290
You said 112, right?

141
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,749
Yes, 112.

142
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,499
That's no problem.

143
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:40,915
You can make it 150.

144
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,790
What a bitch. She can whine...

145
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,957
...but she can't fuck.

146
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,082
What is her problem?

147
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:04,165
Let it go, dude.
Go fuck other chicks.

148
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,832
Maybe one without kids,
one who isn't pregnant.

149
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,082
I'm loving this.
Hanging out all day.

150
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:15,082
I just need to fill out the papers
for more free money.

151
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,957
That's what I was thinking.

152
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:23,624
Gentlemen at pump two,
please put out your cigarettes.

153
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,790
Thank you... for that.

154
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,249
Can you pay for this?

155
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,915
I just got work done on the car.

156
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,332
Of course.

157
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:46,582
That's 94 euros, please.

158
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,415
Get me a carton, dude.

159
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:57,290
That will be 132 euros, please.

160
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,415
CARD DECLINED

161
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:04,040
O, my god. What happened?

162
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,874
I go and buy some stuff
and my money is gone?

163
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:12,082
How much do I get from those
dickheads? I can't live like this.

164
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,332
Hey... Dries.

165
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,999
I owe you this one. We have to go.

166
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,457
Take care!

167
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,624
Social Security Office

168
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,165
I'm not getting enough money, dude.

169
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,165
I understand.

170
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,124
I want you to write down our names.

171
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,040
Richard Batsbak.

172
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,290
Robbie Schuurmans.

173
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,624
Rikkert Biemans.

174
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,499
Barrie Butsers.

175
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:54,040
And also include that ugly ass
Gerrie van Boven while you're at it.

176
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,499
Sure. And what can I do for you?

177
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:01,457
What do you think?
You need to give us more money, cunt!

178
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,707
Unfortunately
I won't be able to do that.

179
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,415
Give us more money, cunt!

180
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,415
'Dear Mr. R. Batsbak...

181
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,832
As a result of the serious threats...

182
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,957
...addressed to our main office...

183
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,665
...we need to inform you...

184
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:02,582
We need to inform you that as of
today you won't be receiving...

185
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,707
...unemployment benefits.

186
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:09,207
This also applies to Mr. R. Schuurmans...

187
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,457
...Mr. R. Biemans, Mr. B. Butsers...

188
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,874
...Mr. G. Van Boven.

189
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:18,249
Kind regards, Chairman of the Board.'

190
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:23,957
Goddammit!

191
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,457
None of us are getting any money.

192
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,540
If they want to play hard ball,
that's fine.

193
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:34,915
Then I won't be paying
for anything anymore!

194
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,207
What?

195
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:43,165
We won't be paying
for anything anymore!

196
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,124
Yes!

197
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:58,707
Last warning

198
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,665
- I don't see anything.
- Over there, dude.

199
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,457
Hey!

200
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:14,082
If I ever see you here again,
I will kill you, cunt!

201
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,915
Public Prosecutor

202
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:20,624
Chinese? Get me a Chinese
rice table for five persons.

203
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,040
That's 89 euros and 20 cents.

204
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,832
I don't have any money.

205
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,332
Goddammit!

206
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,374
- Mister Batsbak?
- Yes.

207
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,957
- R. Batsbak?
- All right.

208
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,790
You have a delinquent balance on...

209
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,790
Truck driver.

210
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,415
Ok, but...

211
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,040
Here's the door.

212
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,624
Good job, dude.
Here's some money.

213
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,332
Ok, thanks.

214
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,832
- Are you Richard Batsbak?
- Yes. So?

215
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,499
Mister Batsbak. Finally.

216
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,665
I'm with the collection agency,
and I have some bad news.

217
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:25,582
You haven't responded
to our payment reminders.

218
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,749
Regarding your delinquent balance.

219
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:28,957
And?

220
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,415
And? As a result you
now only have two days...

221
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:36,624
- I won't pay for anything anymore.
- You won't pay?

222
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,332
That's not how it works.

223
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:43,124
Are you deaf?
I don't have money, cunt!

224
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:46,499
And if I had it, you wouldn't get it,
you asshole!

225
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:48,832
Now, get out of here!

226
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,290
We can't tolerate that, sir.

227
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,665
We will take care of it.

228
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,874
It's going to be all right.
Make a left here, you said?

229
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:03,040
You, again?

230
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:04,332
Wait.

231
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,207
Leave me alone, dude.
You had to run to the cops.

232
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:13,165
I don't have the money,
so you can't get it from me, cunt!

233
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:22,165
Good afternoon. In Maaskantje a person
has decided to stop paying for anything.

234
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:28,082
When an officer and a bill collector
tried to change his mind...

235
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,207
...he made it very clear
that they were not welcome.

236
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:36,582
This is a man who refuses
to pay off his debt.

237
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:39,582
And he can't get away with that.

238
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,790
So I'm assuming
he hasn't been arrested?

239
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:45,207
That's correct.

240
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:48,499
But again, he won't get away with this.

241
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:52,040
If we would all behave this way,
we would have chaos.

242
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:55,832
That cop got smashed.
Look at his black eye.

243
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,915
Pussy!

244
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:00,832
Dickhead!

245
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:04,165
How do you deal with the situation?

246
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:08,124
I'm just doing my job.

247
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:15,707
This unusual event has shocked
the quiet town of Maaskantje.

248
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:19,415
This is Peter Vernhout,
reporting live from Maaskantje.

249
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,540
Hey, Henk. What about
my four bakpaos, dude?

250
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:26,790
My god. You, again?
Get your asses out of here!

251
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:29,790
My face is burned
because of you, ugly cunt!

252
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:33,999
Easy, dude.
Get your hands off Gerrie!

253
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:35,707
That's right!

254
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:39,290
Easy, dude. Just give us the food,
and put it on our tab.

255
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:41,832
You don't have a tab!

256
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,332
Get out, goddammit!

257
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:48,540
Easy, dude. With you AIDS-face!

258
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:51,165
Out!

259
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,582
Where is Rikkert?

260
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,040
Who is he?

261
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:09,832
This is The Dave.

262
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,332
Want some XTC?

263
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:14,665
- What did you say?
- Want to buy some XTC?

264
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:17,790
Some diamonds or mitsubitchis?

265
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:22,374
You're probably interested in
the old school stuff. The ones...

266
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:24,749
...that make you tweak, right?

267
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,915
I got those.

268
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:30,999
He's my new boyfriend.
He's from Schijndel.

269
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,374
Goddammit. Already?

270
00:25:36,541 --> 00:25:37,874
You fucking whore!

271
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:40,749
You know what?

272
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,874
Two can play that game.
I'm going to fuck other girls.

273
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:45,707
No problem, dude!

274
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,165
Take care...

275
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,290
...you whore!

276
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:00,499
Such a whore!

277
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,082
Hi baby, are you horny?

278
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,249
I am so horny.

279
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:12,249
Good. I want to fuck you.
Can't we meet somewhere?

280
00:26:12,416 --> 00:26:14,624
Are you in the area?
In Maaskantje?

281
00:26:14,791 --> 00:26:19,207
Can't we chat for a bit? I want
to feel you inside my shaved pussy.

282
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:23,457
That's nice.
But can't you come here?

283
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,457
So I can fuck you,
and then you can leave.

284
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,582
I want you to fuck me in my ass.
Very hard and deep.

285
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,874
You sound like a big boy.
Oh, you're so big.

286
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:35,290
Yes, you stupid whore.

287
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:37,790
I told you to come
meet me, goddammit.

288
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:39,999
Maaskantje, close to
Den Dungen, you know.

289
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,665
Oh, I'm so horny.

290
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:48,499
Never mind!

291
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:50,790
You stupid whore!

292
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:56,957
Adrie, you are a police officer.

293
00:26:57,541 --> 00:27:00,582
You have to show them authority.

294
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,457
Nobody will take us seriously.

295
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:07,207
Dickheads! Let me out of here.
I didn't rob anybody.

296
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,915
Joost van Gaalen again?

297
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:12,540
We have forces coming in
from Schijndel.

298
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:15,040
And we're going to get
these guys, understood?

299
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,499
I got it.

300
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:32,582
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

301
00:27:36,291 --> 00:27:38,915
We're with Brabant TV.

302
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:43,040
My name is Peter Vernhout.
And this is Rene.

303
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,957
Rene is our cameraman.

304
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:52,707
We were wondering if we
could ask you a few questions?

305
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:53,957
What for?

306
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:58,624
We did an interview here earlier.
You know, with your local police officer.

307
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,582
- How much do we get for it?
- Well, that's not how it works.

308
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,707
Forty euros!

309
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:10,665
That's a reasonable amount.
I think we can do that.

310
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:13,165
- A hundred euros!
- That's...

311
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,957
That might be too much.
I don't think...

312
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:17,540
A thousand euros!

313
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:23,415
How much money did you bring?

314
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:25,832
So... A hundred, right?

315
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:31,415
A hundred and fifty, dude!
Don't try to screw us, cunt!

316
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,915
I'm just a normal, hardworking...

317
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:48,457
...guy, you know.

318
00:28:48,916 --> 00:28:51,665
My dog means
everything to me! Gradje.

319
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:54,457
Such a sweet dog, dude.

320
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:57,582
He needs to eat special food.

321
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,415
His intestines are sensitive.

322
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:06,207
But I got fired, because
I brought my dog with me to work.

323
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:10,290
But he's sick, you understand?
I can't leave him at home by himself.

324
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:16,707
That is such a sweet dog, dude.

325
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:23,415
My god, that is a sweet dog.

326
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:27,582
And because of the crisis
it's been hard to find a new job.

327
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:33,624
You could get unemployment benefits.

328
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:35,749
Dude, they don't give me
enough money.

329
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:39,915
Me too, dude.
I got fired because of the crisis.

330
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:45,457
And then I lost my wife and my kids,
because I couldn't take care of them.

331
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:48,415
And now they don't send us
our checks...

332
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:50,999
...because Richard asked
for a little bit more money.

333
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:54,624
Because he needed it to buy
special food for his dog.

334
00:29:55,916 --> 00:29:57,749
That sucks, man.

335
00:29:58,041 --> 00:30:02,124
Richard, Rikkert, Gerrie,
Robbie and Barrie.

336
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,832
Five guys without a job and without
unemployment benefits...

337
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:08,290
Are they dangerous swindlers...

338
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:11,624
...or victims of this crisis?
You decide for yourself.

339
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:15,207
Those asshole cops!
They are not going to give up.

340
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:17,832
They could come after us.

341
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:20,499
And then what?
Let them come here.

342
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:23,582
We will beat them up again,
those homos.

343
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,499
Hit them in the face.

344
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,165
I will clean that up.

345
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:08,999
Doesn't that look nice?

346
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:58,790
Richard Batsbak!

347
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:03,332
If you don't come outside within
five seconds, we will come in.

348
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:19,749
Dude!

349
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:29,665
Ten, nine...

350
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:31,707
...eight, seven...

351
00:32:36,291 --> 00:32:38,457
Goddammit!

352
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:47,915
Hey, Columbo!

353
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:51,249
How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't have any money!

354
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,457
You can't get anything
from a man who is broke, cunt!

355
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:55,790
Stupid cunt!

356
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:58,665
I won't pay for anything anymore!

357
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:04,874
Well, ladies and gentlemen...

358
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:07,874
The police didn't make
a strong impression.

359
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:10,582
Hey, homo.

360
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:14,415
We won't pay for anything anymore either.

361
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:17,832
Hand me four more beers, dude.

362
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:21,457
Stupid cunt!

363
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:34,082
What do you want?

364
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:38,499
We were wondering
if we could...

365
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:41,832
...shoot a documentary.

366
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:05,665
It was going well.
But then officer Wanrooy...

367
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:09,332
I don't want to hear it!
Enough excuses.

368
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:13,374
Tomorrow a few colleagues from
Den Bosch will come to arrest the boys.

369
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:16,749
And you will go with them.
You could learn from them.

370
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:22,540
Are you guys fucking each other?
Homo cops!

371
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:28,249
Last night was the start of a series
of riots throughout the Brabant region.

372
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:32,624
Incidents have been reported in
Den Bosch, Eindhoven, Schijndel, Breda...

373
00:34:32,791 --> 00:34:34,499
...and even Budel.

374
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:43,207
People refuse to be victims of this crisis,
and take matters into their own hands.

375
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:49,624
Yesterday, this group of guys
from Maaskantje gave the example.

376
00:34:56,416 --> 00:35:00,040
Dad... I love you...

377
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:05,290
Hey cunt! Look at this.

378
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,415
This is crazy!

379
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:10,457
What do you mean?

380
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,665
Look at this fucking mess!
It's all broken, cunt!

381
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:16,499
Take it easy.
Not everything is broken.

382
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:19,707
Look at this. This is still working.

383
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:28,207
Goddammit,
you are such a stupid cunt!

384
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:30,540
You are a real bum!

385
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,707
Stay away from my nuggets, cunt.

386
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:37,999
Dude, what are you doing?
Goddammit, you are such a stupid cunt!

387
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:43,290
Barry! I know someone
who can give us money.

388
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:47,082
Rikkert, I'm taking the car.
I'm going to Den Bosch.

389
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:50,374
Suck my cock.

390
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,707
We will pay you later.

391
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:59,707
It's all good, dude.

392
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:17,957
Take care!

393
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,415
I want it back in two days,
plus 20 percent.

394
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:49,915
Of course, dude.
In two days you will get it back.

395
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,665
My promise to you. I swear.

396
00:36:57,208 --> 00:37:01,207
Me and my buddies will guarantee it.
You don't have to worry.

397
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:14,665
It's going to be all right.

398
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,707
Go Peter!

399
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,957
You're number one!

400
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:23,999
Take care!

401
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:30,082
Goddammit!

402
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,457
Rikkert, your car!

403
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:36,082
It won't work, dude.
Look at that lock.

404
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,874
I got the strongest U-lock.

405
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:45,540
My car rim! Hey, cunt!

406
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:48,249
That's a good U-lock,
goddammit.

407
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:55,290
Hey!

408
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:01,290
No!

409
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:04,915
That's my Opel Manta!

410
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:07,540
Cunt!

411
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:19,790
- What do you want?
- It's Gerrie. come to Den Bosch.

412
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,915
Come to the Rompert Casino.
I found a solution to our problems.

413
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:26,874
Due to the delinquent
status on your account...

414
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:29,999
...your phone service
has been suspended.

415
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,707
We have to go somewhere.
You can wait inside.

416
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,249
And you better
not steal anything, dude.

417
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:47,499
Gerrie has a plan.
I'm curious to see what that is.

418
00:38:47,666 --> 00:38:51,915
I lost my job, my girl
and my ride, goddammit!

419
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:56,665
How come Barrie and Gerrie
didn't take the scooter?

420
00:38:57,916 --> 00:38:58,999
What?

421
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:21,124
I guess we have to walk.

422
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:22,999
Goddammit!

423
00:39:46,791 --> 00:39:47,999
Sorry.

424
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:51,790
I took a shit in my jail cell,
there's shit everywhere!

425
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,707
Where did you get
all this money, dude?

426
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:15,790
No more bets.

427
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:19,457
Hey, cunt! Tell me where
you got all this money!

428
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,249
Pay attention.

429
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:30,499
Where did you get the money?

430
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:35,082
Red 23, congratulations.

431
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:45,540
Goddammit! What are the odds?

432
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:49,207
Gerrie is the man!

433
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:51,332
But he looks like an ass.

434
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:55,124
Black 11. Too bad.

435
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:05,290
Goddammit!

436
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:07,207
What a homo.

437
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:12,249
I don't get it, man.

438
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:14,790
This wasn't suppose to happen.

439
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:17,207
You are such a mongoloid.

440
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:21,457
This tastes good, dude. Coconut.

441
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,915
Don't worry, dude.

442
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,499
That guy lives all the way
in Den Bosch.

443
00:41:27,666 --> 00:41:30,249
He won't come down to Maaskantje.

444
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,249
I don't have a job.

445
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:39,540
I lost my Opel Manta.

446
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,457
I lost Manuela.

447
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:44,207
She has a new boyfriend. Homo.

448
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:50,165
All I wanted was to fuck.

449
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:52,999
Just fuck, you know. Fuck.

450
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,499
That new guy probably
fucked her already.

451
00:41:56,666 --> 00:41:59,915
What about me?
No, she won't fuck me.

452
00:42:00,541 --> 00:42:04,665
Why can't I ever have sex?

453
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:06,915
For once.

454
00:42:09,458 --> 00:42:12,207
Are you a virgin or something?

455
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:15,040
No.

456
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:18,374
He is still a virgin.

457
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:20,499
Hey, homo!

458
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,582
Homo!

459
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:33,999
Police - Confiscated

460
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:37,540
Goddammit!
Who do they think they are?

461
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:40,457
They moved quickly.

462
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:51,915
I'm going to see Manuela.
And fuck her.

463
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,665
Sure, dude.

464
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:58,874
Go and do that.

465
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:02,915
Make sure you get
the right hole. Virgin!

466
00:43:29,583 --> 00:43:32,790
You have such a nice pussy.

467
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:42,207
I can't wait to come inside you.
Fill you up with semen.

468
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:44,749
You are such a hot chick.

469
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,207
Take care. See you tonight.

470
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:57,874
Hey, cunt!

471
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,915
...I slapped her face with my hard cock.
Like this.

472
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:08,207
She was laughing, dude.

473
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:16,832
Truck driver!

474
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,832
Honk, honk.

475
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,082
There is shit on the wall.

476
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:48,749
He didn't eat the right food.

477
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:55,207
Isn't that sad?

478
00:44:57,333 --> 00:45:01,499
You want to drink something, Gradje?
You'll like that.

479
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:12,457
They cut off the water too?

480
00:45:12,833 --> 00:45:13,957
Cunts!

481
00:45:18,291 --> 00:45:21,457
Ground forces ready?
The warning shot means go.

482
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:27,707
What are you doing
with that bone, dude?

483
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:30,082
It tastes all right. A bit salty.

484
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:32,749
That's Gradje's bone, cunt!

485
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:36,624
Do you know how hard life is
for that dog?

486
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:56,082
They're shooting on us.

487
00:46:12,708 --> 00:46:14,665
Reinout Oerlemans - Producer

488
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:17,999
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have some bad news.

489
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:21,915
We are out of money. We have
spent all the money in the budget.

490
00:46:22,083 --> 00:46:25,332
I apologize. We have to cancel
the production.

491
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:30,915
We've tried everything to get more
money, but it didn't work out.

492
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:35,707
But to ensure that you won't leave
the theater feeling frustrated...

493
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:39,749
...we have decided that the boys
will tell you the rest of the story...

494
00:46:39,916 --> 00:46:43,874
...so at least you know
how good the ending...

495
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:47,124
...would have been.
So boys, come over here.

496
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:50,499
There's the camera.

497
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,332
Good luck!

498
00:46:55,833 --> 00:46:57,749
Goddammit.

499
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:08,582
Do I have to tell
the whole fucking story?

500
00:47:10,708 --> 00:47:12,707
Gerrie, you tell them.

501
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,540
I don't think so, dude.

502
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:23,290
So...

503
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,082
The coppers were shooting at us!

504
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,332
- Coppers!
- Yes, coppers!

505
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,624
So we were running from them
and shook them off. Homos!

506
00:47:32,791 --> 00:47:36,999
So we got to the grocery store. We saw
Rikkert's girl, she was closing the store.

507
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:41,332
She was standing there with
her naked pussy. A big one, dude!

508
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,499
Don't talk shit about Manuela.
What do you mean 'naked pussy'?

509
00:47:46,666 --> 00:47:48,915
- I just thought she was naked.
- No, she wasn't.

510
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:55,165
So we hid there.
We thought the dog was dead.

511
00:47:55,333 --> 00:47:58,582
Richard went home,
and found him still alive!

512
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,540
He just wouldn't die.
A true die-hard!

513
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:18,290
Such a sweet dog, dude.

514
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:22,374
You gave him a funeral, right?

515
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:25,749
A real ceremony, right?

516
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:49,749
So we were at the store.

517
00:48:49,916 --> 00:48:54,165
Rikkert and Manuela were there,
she was naked again.

518
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:55,790
Dude!

519
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:59,915
What, dude?
So Rikkert fucked her like this.

520
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:09,707
Hey!

521
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:13,790
Virgin. Fuck!

522
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:20,249
Hey, did you fuck her or not?

523
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:21,540
Yes.

524
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:22,749
Virgin!

525
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:27,249
So she started whining of course.
Such a slut. She's been around.

526
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:40,915
What I meant was...

527
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:45,040
...that she should have looked
after her two kids.

528
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:53,207
Do you boys like sausages?

529
00:49:55,916 --> 00:50:00,540
The next day I went outside,
and guess who I ran into, dude.

530
00:50:00,708 --> 00:50:04,665
Peter Aerts! Such a homo.

531
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:06,832
He asked where his money was.

532
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,332
What, dude?
Where is my money, dude?

533
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,582
Wham, wham!

534
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:48,082
That's bullshit, dude.
You were dreaming, homo!

535
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:52,582
What were you thinking, borrowing
money from The Lumberjack?

536
00:50:53,416 --> 00:50:57,249
Dude, I came up with a great plan.

537
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,332
To kidnap Jody Bernal!

538
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:15,957
What a homo, dude.

539
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:21,290
We had him perform anyway,
so we could steal the ticket money.

540
00:51:21,958 --> 00:51:26,582
The show was in Schotsveld, you know?
I fingered llona van Zoggel there.

541
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:30,499
We ran inside. The coppers were
behind us. The place was packed.

542
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:33,207
But they started shooting.

543
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:41,124
They missed me!
Cross-eyed coppers!

544
00:51:41,291 --> 00:51:44,915
So we ran outside.
We stole a car from this couple.

545
00:51:45,083 --> 00:51:47,040
Rikkert got in and sat
on their baby.

546
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:52,415
Sorry.

547
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:05,624
What a stupid ass cop!
He ruined the van, killed a family...

548
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:09,165
...and lost his job.

549
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,832
You can stay home.

550
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:22,624
We were driving like crazy...

551
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:32,874
So we were driving.
We lost the coppers.

552
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:37,332
We shook them off.

553
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:45,457
It is him again.

554
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:51,790
I just found this in my desk.
Now get back to work! Peter?

555
00:52:53,666 --> 00:52:55,957
That's a nice leather jacket!

556
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,415
Peter Kelder.

557
00:53:14,416 --> 00:53:16,332
So we are back on.

558
00:53:24,541 --> 00:53:26,290
We lost the cops!

559
00:53:36,166 --> 00:53:39,915
Do you hate paying your taxes
as much as I do?

560
00:53:43,583 --> 00:53:45,082
Take care! I'm out!

561
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:49,874
That was the hit show 'My name is Ronnie'.
We continue with our news headlines.

562
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:52,290
Since the start of riots in the South...

563
00:53:52,458 --> 00:53:56,207
...there have been outbreaks
of violence in other regions.

564
00:53:56,375 --> 00:54:00,332
Incidents have been reported
in the regions of Utrecht, Zuid-Holland...

565
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,249
...Gelderland and Overijssel.

566
00:54:02,416 --> 00:54:06,582
It started with five guys from Maaskantje
who refuse to pay for anything anymore.

567
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:10,124
Here are Berry and Daniel
with the weather forecast.

568
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,707
The car is trashed!

569
00:55:06,291 --> 00:55:07,707
Piece of shit.

570
00:55:09,458 --> 00:55:10,832
Where is Gerrie?

571
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,957
He should stay far away from me.

572
00:55:53,458 --> 00:55:55,165
Guys...

573
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:59,207
We should keep moving.
I'm ready.

574
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:02,165
Where are we going?

575
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:07,540
Ministry of Defence
The Hague

576
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:12,040
Leave me alone, you fucking cop!
I won't pay for anything.

577
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,290
What city is this?

578
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:19,207
It's actually happening throughout
the whole region of Brabant.

579
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:24,915
Who are responsible?

580
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,415
A few guys from Maaskant...

581
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:30,832
Maaskantje.

582
00:56:31,291 --> 00:56:33,540
- From where?
- Maaskantje.

583
00:56:33,916 --> 00:56:35,124
Never heard of it.

584
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:40,499
I didn't know it either. Apparently
it's south of Den Bosch.

585
00:56:40,666 --> 00:56:43,499
I'm not paying. Bonfire!

586
00:56:46,208 --> 00:56:47,499
Maaskant, right?

587
00:56:47,916 --> 00:56:50,582
And why haven't they been arrested?

588
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:56,707
Maaskan-tje. We're not sure why.
We're unclear on the situation.

589
00:56:57,291 --> 00:57:01,499
Anyway, the cops haven't
been able to arrest them.

590
00:57:01,666 --> 00:57:04,332
I will throw a rock!

591
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:12,874
So if we get rid those guys from Maaskant,
everything will go back to normal?

592
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,165
I would think so.

593
00:57:19,125 --> 00:57:21,374
Just bomb the place.

594
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,290
Who would remember Maaskant?

595
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:28,832
- Maaskantje.
- Right.

596
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,290
I had never heard of it.

597
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:32,957
I didn't know it either.

598
00:57:33,208 --> 00:57:34,707
So we agree on that.

599
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:38,207
That is all?

600
00:57:43,041 --> 00:57:44,207
Yes.

601
00:57:47,083 --> 00:57:48,582
Oh, no.

602
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:52,874
I heard that there is still
someone out there...

603
00:57:53,041 --> 00:57:55,582
...a cameraman.

604
00:57:55,958 --> 00:57:58,499
But that won't be a problem.

605
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:01,749
Gerrie, that cunt!

606
00:58:01,916 --> 00:58:05,582
He's acting like a child.
Such a homo.

607
00:58:07,666 --> 00:58:09,249
I'm hungry.

608
00:58:21,583 --> 00:58:24,290
That was big ass ball of fire!

609
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:25,749
Bam!

610
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:29,707
It hit Schijndel, cunt!

611
00:58:34,375 --> 00:58:38,290
Have you ever heard of a town
called Schijndel?

612
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:41,290
Good.

613
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:43,832
Another one?

614
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,249
That is possible.

615
00:58:46,416 --> 00:58:49,040
But it will take eight hours.

616
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:53,374
Just send our best guys, and take
them out. How many are there?

617
00:58:58,708 --> 00:58:59,832
Five.

618
00:59:00,208 --> 00:59:03,124
We will send fifty. That will bring
an end to this nonsense, right?

619
00:59:03,291 --> 00:59:05,499
- Yes, I would think so.
- Good.

620
00:59:17,125 --> 00:59:18,457
No!

621
00:59:18,625 --> 00:59:20,707
Barrie!

622
00:59:40,958 --> 00:59:42,915
That wasn't too bad.

623
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:44,415
Where did it go?

624
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:53,790
Look at this! Look at this!

625
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:07,582
- This is the real deal.
- Yes.

626
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:10,540
Can I see it?

627
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:19,540
You deserved that, cunt!

628
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:22,124
Where did you get this?

629
01:00:36,125 --> 01:00:40,332
We don't know why the town
of Schijndel...

630
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:43,624
...was attacked.

631
01:00:43,791 --> 01:00:49,207
We suspect a technical
error in Belgium...

632
01:00:49,375 --> 01:00:53,040
...accidently activated a Scud missile.

633
01:00:53,208 --> 01:00:54,665
Scud missile...

634
01:00:54,833 --> 01:00:55,999
Scunt.

635
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:59,457
This wasn't a human error,
but a technical error.

636
01:00:59,625 --> 01:01:03,665
Goddammit, this fucking camera!
I'm going to the van, I'll be right back.

637
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:06,999
Even though many people died,
there is no reason for a panic.

638
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:11,082
We have declared a state of emergency,
and have sent paramedics...

639
01:01:11,458 --> 01:01:13,832
From World War II.

640
01:01:14,166 --> 01:01:15,874
But they still work!

641
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:22,374
Hey, virgin!

642
01:01:22,541 --> 01:01:25,082
Forget that girl, dude.

643
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:37,457
Rene, are you with me?

644
01:02:03,166 --> 01:02:05,540
Are The Netherlands
and Belgium at war?

645
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:10,624
No, absolutely not.

646
01:02:11,291 --> 01:02:14,624
What I've been trying to explain,
is that it was an accident.

647
01:02:19,458 --> 01:02:23,832
Behind me you see the remains
of what used to be Schijndel.

648
01:02:24,291 --> 01:02:28,874
I've heard from reliable sources, that
this was not caused by a technical error...

649
01:02:29,208 --> 01:02:34,040
...but a failed attack on Maaskantje
ordered by the Dutch government...

650
01:02:35,291 --> 01:02:38,915
...to kill five guys.

651
01:02:39,166 --> 01:02:42,040
I would like to warn the people
in Maaskantje.

652
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:45,457
Leave with your families.
It's not safe here.

653
01:02:45,625 --> 01:02:48,582
Craziness! Man!

654
01:02:49,041 --> 01:02:52,499
This is Peter Vernhout reporting
live from Maaskantje.

655
01:02:52,666 --> 01:02:55,332
Take care and good luck!

656
01:02:55,875 --> 01:03:01,124
Goddammit!
They want to destroy our town?

657
01:03:01,291 --> 01:03:02,749
I don't think so!

658
01:03:03,291 --> 01:03:05,832
Nobody touches Maaskantje!

659
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:10,040
Can we borrow that?

660
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,457
Sure.

661
01:03:13,083 --> 01:03:15,415
I have some more in the barn.

662
01:03:27,541 --> 01:03:30,290
You can each pick one.

663
01:03:44,125 --> 01:03:47,207
Those were the good old days,
the war.

664
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:51,790
This place was packed
with Jews in 1942.

665
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:57,540
You would hand them over to the Nazis
and they would give you anything.

666
01:03:58,208 --> 01:04:00,040
That was a good deal.

667
01:04:00,208 --> 01:04:05,124
Goebbels gave me this jacket.

668
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:08,915
Personally!
He was a nice guy.

669
01:04:30,958 --> 01:04:32,457
More weapons!

670
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:33,665
Yes!

671
01:04:52,291 --> 01:04:55,540
Nicky, Danny, come here!

672
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:59,832
Nicky, Danny! You'll be in trouble!

673
01:05:00,083 --> 01:05:08,082
Nicky, Danny!

674
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:46,124
Hey, cunt!

675
01:06:00,541 --> 01:06:02,165
Nicky?

676
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,749
Danny?

677
01:06:05,083 --> 01:06:06,415
Nicky?

678
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,290
Thank you.

679
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:40,665
No problem.

680
01:06:47,541 --> 01:06:49,832
Goddammit. Such a long drive.

681
01:07:14,083 --> 01:07:17,457
Keep your hands off my croquettes.

682
01:07:17,625 --> 01:07:19,124
Get out!

683
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:24,332
Can Manuela and the kids
stay here for a while?

684
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:28,540
All right. Fine.

685
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,999
So I take it you're not leaving?

686
01:07:35,208 --> 01:07:39,124
No, dude. This food joint is my life.
I won't let anybody take it away.

687
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:43,999
Then I guess you could use this.

688
01:08:15,083 --> 01:08:16,915
I am here to help you.

689
01:08:18,416 --> 01:08:20,124
Craziness!

690
01:08:45,041 --> 01:08:49,040
Get closer! Just aim straight, cunt!

691
01:09:07,541 --> 01:09:10,124
You did good, cunt!

692
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:31,124
Hey, you fucking cop!
Let me out, you homo!

693
01:09:39,333 --> 01:09:41,874
Goddammit, too much recoil!

694
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:57,790
One, two, three...

695
01:10:26,291 --> 01:10:28,790
Manuela!
What are you doing here?

696
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,624
I got bored.

697
01:10:35,291 --> 01:10:37,707
So you promise
that you will help me?

698
01:10:37,875 --> 01:10:39,999
And don't act weird, okay?

699
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:42,874
Are you sure?

700
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:21,665
Gerrie!

701
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:23,749
You saved my life!

702
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:28,749
I am so proud of you. I couldn't
have asked for a better son.

703
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:37,374
- What are you talking about?
- Gerrie...

704
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,499
I am your father.

705
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:44,957
That is my jacket.

706
01:11:46,458 --> 01:11:50,374
When you were little,
I left you with your mother.

707
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:55,249
I was way too young, and I could tell
that you were going to be a loser.

708
01:11:55,416 --> 01:11:57,707
And my food joint was far more
important to me.

709
01:11:57,875 --> 01:12:01,457
I was embarrassed to have
such an ugly child. But...

710
01:12:01,875 --> 01:12:03,749
...you saved my life.

711
01:12:04,125 --> 01:12:08,457
I'm so proud of your ugly ass. I want
everyone to know that I'm your dad.

712
01:12:09,791 --> 01:12:10,999
Dad...

713
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:12,915
Son...

714
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:37,165
Do you want to have a turn?

715
01:12:37,791 --> 01:12:38,999
Sure.

716
01:13:11,375 --> 01:13:12,957
Cover-up?

717
01:13:33,958 --> 01:13:36,040
Richard! Richard!

718
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:51,707
This one is for Gradje, cunt!

719
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:56,207
Goddammit!

720
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:26,749
Drop your weapons!
Or I will shoot your friend.

721
01:14:26,916 --> 01:14:28,915
You too, mustache!

722
01:14:57,833 --> 01:14:59,957
Truck driver!

723
01:15:17,416 --> 01:15:19,582
Nobody touches Maaskantje!

724
01:15:22,666 --> 01:15:23,874
Bang!

725
01:15:29,375 --> 01:15:30,832
Fucking mongoloid!

726
01:15:35,375 --> 01:15:36,665
Hey, cop!

727
01:15:36,916 --> 01:15:40,540
You did that with your foot?
Cool!

728
01:16:00,208 --> 01:16:01,540
Dude, where's Rikkert?

729
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:21,457
What about my boyfriend?

730
01:16:21,625 --> 01:16:23,165
He is dead.

731
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:26,790
Okay.

732
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:40,999
Nice tribal.

733
01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:10,874
Rikkert is no longer a virgin!

734
01:17:23,541 --> 01:17:25,665
I will have to put you under arrest.

735
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:27,749
What?

736
01:17:27,916 --> 01:17:29,207
Well...

737
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:32,082
Unpaid fines and stuff...

738
01:17:34,125 --> 01:17:36,124
What do you think?

739
01:17:36,708 --> 01:17:38,249
Please?

740
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:48,832
R. Batsbak, G. Van Boven...

741
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,915
...R. Biemans, B. Butsers
and R. Schuurmans...

742
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:54,415
...the defendants...

743
01:17:54,875 --> 01:18:00,207
...are found guilty of the following:

744
01:18:01,291 --> 01:18:07,499
Destroying private property,

745
01:18:07,666 --> 01:18:09,624
...public intoxication...

746
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:13,957
...drug possession...

747
01:18:14,625 --> 01:18:17,290
...disrespecting an officer on duty...

748
01:18:17,458 --> 01:18:21,665
...disrespecting an officer off duty,
indecent exposure...

749
01:18:21,833 --> 01:18:26,624
...robbery, third degree assault...

750
01:18:26,916 --> 01:18:30,165
...speeding...

751
01:18:30,625 --> 01:18:33,999
...kidnapping,
destroying City property...

752
01:18:34,166 --> 01:18:37,790
...extortion, tax evasion,
weapon possession, fraud...

753
01:18:37,958 --> 01:18:40,165
...polluting the environment...

754
01:18:40,333 --> 01:18:43,624
...unpaid parking tickets...

755
01:18:43,916 --> 01:18:46,207
...withholding evidence...

756
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:52,624
...and 39 charges of
voluntary manslaughter.

757
01:18:54,666 --> 01:18:57,874
The court of Den Bosch...

758
01:18:58,041 --> 01:19:00,582
...sentences each one of you...

759
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:03,499
...to 240 hours of public service.

760
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:21,790
Brabant is quiet and peaceful again...

761
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:26,499
...after the instigators
got their sentences.

762
01:19:26,666 --> 01:19:32,290
People have gone back to their lives,
and are coping with the damage.

763
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:35,290
Other news. Our defence minister
has not been found yet.

764
01:19:36,208 --> 01:19:37,332
Do you remember me?

765
01:19:39,333 --> 01:19:42,040
Stupid cunt!
You owe me money!

766
01:19:42,708 --> 01:19:45,082
Shut your mouth, cunt!

767
01:19:45,875 --> 01:19:49,457
I will break your neck, dude!
Try to stop me!

768
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:53,290
Try to stop me!

769
01:19:57,583 --> 01:19:59,707
DJ Paul Elstak!

770
01:20:39,791 --> 01:20:43,040
Don't talk about
my dog like that.

771
01:20:43,291 --> 01:20:44,540
Movie theater homos!

772
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:55,415
So you you believe...
Let's start over.

773
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:58,124
Let me out of here,
homo!

774
01:20:58,583 --> 01:21:01,624
Hey! Are you fucking
or something?

775
01:21:14,083 --> 01:21:16,540
She's been around.

776
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:18,165
I don't feel anything.

777
01:21:26,875 --> 01:21:28,624
...fucking whore.

778
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,082
Dammit! You ruined...

779
01:21:38,291 --> 01:21:39,332
It broke.

780
01:21:54,916 --> 01:21:57,249
Paul, dude.
Add some turbo, man.

781
01:22:19,416 --> 01:22:23,415
No! My Opel Manta!

782
01:22:24,083 --> 01:22:25,624
Fuck, that was
to the camera.

783
01:22:39,708 --> 01:22:42,040
Hit her head, her cheek.

784
01:22:42,208 --> 01:22:44,999
Sperm splashes
through the air.

785
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:49,332
Use the fingers.
Like a rabbit,

786
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,457
pussy and anus.

787
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:53,915
His mom's a whore.

788
01:22:54,083 --> 01:22:56,040
I hit him in the neck.

789
01:22:56,208 --> 01:22:59,415
Don't touch my cake, dude.

790
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,665
Look! I just found this
in my desk...

791
01:23:17,833 --> 01:23:18,874
Let's do that again.

792
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:22,999
I just found this.
In my desk. So...

793
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:24,207
Fuck!

794
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:27,540
I just found this.
In my desk.

795
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:30,290
No, fuck.

796
01:24:04,333 --> 01:24:05,499
That got trashed.

797
01:24:11,041 --> 01:24:13,499
The court...

798
01:24:13,708 --> 01:24:16,332
...of Den Bosch...

799
01:24:17,166 --> 01:24:19,374
...will revoke your...

800
01:24:19,541 --> 01:24:21,874
...driving license.

801
01:24:22,791 --> 01:24:25,415
Truck driver. Honk, honk.
