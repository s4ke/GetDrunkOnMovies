1
00:00:27,084 --> 00:00:29,284
We're federal agents, we are not martyrs!

2
00:00:31,444 --> 00:00:32,644
This is suicide!

3
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:36,164
She is just one of many abductions.

4
00:00:36,764 --> 00:00:38,604
Why is this abduction so special!

5
00:00:40,604 --> 00:00:42,484
Is it because she's a witness against
the Torrez?

6
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:48,684
She is probably caught, and drugged.

7
00:00:48,804 --> 00:00:50,564
We do not have to do this!

8
00:00:51,164 --> 00:00:52,244
If not us...

9
00:00:53,404 --> 00:00:54,644
... Who?

10
00:00:57,684 --> 00:00:58,604
I told you to stay still!

11
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:01,164
Do not try to capture the Torrez!

12
00:01:02,324 --> 00:01:03,404
Turn around now!

13
00:01:04,844 --> 00:01:05,884
Machete, you son of a bitch!

14
00:01:06,404 --> 00:01:08,124
Listen to orders!

15
00:01:08,244 --> 00:01:12,804
You'll eventually kill us all!
Wait for reinforcements!

16
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:39,044
Whatever happens...

17
00:01:42,524 --> 00:01:43,404
I'm with you...

18
00:01:45,124 --> 00:01:45,484
... Boss.

19
00:01:47,663 --> 00:01:49,313
This is the BOSS...

20
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:10,964
Sorry.

21
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:01,454
Get dressed.

22
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,966
It's too hot for clothes.

23
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:24,678
You saving me from Torrez?

24
00:03:25,029 --> 00:03:26,383
You've got balls!

25
00:03:26,384 --> 00:03:29,334
That looks like me.

26
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:37,325
What's this long hard thing?

27
00:03:37,326 --> 00:03:38,604
My Machete.

28
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:39,605
Is it sharp?

29
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:41,236
Very...

30
00:03:42,174 --> 00:03:42,809
Good...

31
00:04:01,222 --> 00:04:02,059
I got him

32
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:06,277
Stupid FUCK...

33
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:11,124
I told you to stay away asshole.

34
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:16,644
If you had listened to my orders
you would not have been caught.

35
00:04:17,915 --> 00:04:18,836
How did I do?

36
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,518
Excellent my love.

37
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,966
Excellent...

38
00:04:27,284 --> 00:04:31,044
This is what happens when they insist
to be heroes.

39
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:33,839
Why are you so insistent?

40
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,496
I own the entire force...
And not just here in Mexico.

41
00:04:38,747 --> 00:04:41,296
I own the DEA... I own
the Marshals...

42
00:04:42,544 --> 00:04:44,224
Why can't I own you?

43
00:04:44,225 --> 00:04:46,782
Why don't you take the money
I offered you to look the other way?

44
00:04:47,657 --> 00:04:48,657
What's your price?

45
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:53,226
Maybe I should ask your
wife.

46
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
Bring her in here.

47
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:00,417
No!

48
00:05:02,347 --> 00:05:03,347
Sara!

49
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:08,225
Your daughter... she's in
school right now.

50
00:05:08,582 --> 00:05:09,582
No?

51
00:05:12,406 --> 00:05:13,406
I don't think so.

52
00:05:18,494 --> 00:05:21,206
The honorable way to die...
is to cut off your head.

53
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,310
But.

54
00:05:26,347 --> 00:05:28,792
You don't deserve to die honorably.

55
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:32,204
Burn it!

56
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:23,608
Joining us right now we have Franklin Jones.

57
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:27,267
Deputy Director of our local Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE) office.

58
00:07:27,268 --> 00:07:28,329
Thank you and pleasure to be here.

59
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,768
What steps are you taking to
secure our borders?

60
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:33,625
ICE is working with local law enforcement
to improve patrols...

61
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:36,870
but there's over 2000 miles of border between
Mexico and the U.S.

62
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:41,173
And over half of that is here in Texas,

63
00:07:41,174 --> 00:07:43,521
there's a whole support network.

64
00:07:43,522 --> 00:07:45,419
That not only helps illegal aliens get

65
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,416
across but is helping them get settled.
Once they are here.

66
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:50,409
We need to uncover and dismantle this
network.

67
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,366
It's our top priority and our most
talented ICE agents are investigating them now.

68
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:00,303
Agent Nevada: Day 23 of surveillance for
Operation Network.

69
00:08:02,097 --> 00:08:05,255
The Operation is suspected to be run by
a woman named Loose.

70
00:08:05,256 --> 00:08:07,163
Codename: She.

71
00:08:07,164 --> 00:08:09,318
Tacos Cafe! TACOS!

72
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:12,288
Loose operates a taco's truck at the labour site.

73
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:17,572
There's a interesting...

74
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,190
face.

75
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:24,875
No! That's ok.

76
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,540
Thank you.

77
00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:31,082
He's not...

78
00:08:37,865 --> 00:08:40,124
Run through database for
possible criminal background.

79
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,895
Male, Hispanic, scars, tattoo's

80
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:46,731
Don't fuck with me, I don't
fuck with you attitude.

81
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:49,929
Hey!

82
00:07:38,655 --> 00:07:39,655
So we need to attack the problem at it's source.

83
00:08:50,284 --> 00:08:53,381
You work today
and pay me tomorrow.

84
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:57,436
Hi, lady

85
00:08:57,484 --> 00:08:59,244
You need a gardener?

86
00:09:18,404 --> 00:09:20,444
Come on. Stand back.

87
00:09:23,444 --> 00:09:24,524
Hurry!

88
00:09:26,204 --> 00:09:28,924
We have not got.
You can not leave us here!

89
00:09:28,925 --> 00:09:29,925
Move!

90
00:09:29,924 --> 00:09:31,364
She is sick.

91
00:09:42,643 --> 00:09:43,931
Roundup time!

92
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,790
Look at them!

93
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,470
Speak english?

94
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:14,276
Well, I don't speak much Mexican neither.

95
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,859
You know...

96
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,750
You're trespassing...

97
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:21,163
on my daddy's land.

98
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,441
Jesus Van! Can't you see
she's been childed?

99
00:10:36,544 --> 00:10:39,257
If it gets born here.
It gets to be a citizen.

100
00:10:39,258 --> 00:10:40,911
No different than you or me.

101
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:44,029
I know most people don't like us.

102
00:10:45,782 --> 00:10:47,763
Course... Vigilante's

103
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:51,820
It's really about vigilance.

104
00:10:53,857 --> 00:10:58,529
Somebody’s gonna watch out
for this great nation of ours.

105
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,220
Otherwise...

106
00:11:00,195 --> 00:11:01,717
Texas will become...

107
00:11:01,718 --> 00:11:04,038
Mexico once again.

108
00:11:07,285 --> 00:11:09,007
Who's gonna stop it senator?

109
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,398
I am.

110
00:11:15,253 --> 00:11:16,512
Welcome to America.

111
00:11:20,844 --> 00:11:21,946
You catch all that?

112
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,993
Burn me a DVD. Behind our supporters
are going to like that!

113
00:11:25,454 --> 00:11:26,454
A lot.

114
00:11:28,551 --> 00:11:30,360
The infestation has begun...

115
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:32,071
parasites have crossed our borders...

116
00:11:32,072 --> 00:11:33,660
have sickening our country...

117
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:35,221
leeching off out system...

118
00:11:35,222 --> 00:11:37,485
destroying us from the inside.

119
00:11:37,843 --> 00:11:39,394
But Senator John McLauglin

120
00:11:39,395 --> 00:11:40,839
has a plan of attack.

121
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,163
He'll fight to keep illegal immigrants
OUT!

122
00:12:16,724 --> 00:12:17,604
Hey!

123
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,071
Ugly!

124
00:12:18,844 --> 00:12:20,084
Want to fight?

125
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,830
Don't tell me you don't wanna earn
$500 in five minutes.

126
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,823
That's my man!

127
00:12:30,824 --> 00:12:32,985
Bet's! Place your bets!

128
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:42,329
Fight!

129
00:13:25,613 --> 00:13:26,613
Thanks.

130
00:13:41,616 --> 00:13:43,684
Can I have a beans and cheese.
And a Cafe Ole.

131
00:13:45,084 --> 00:13:46,397
Ain't got no cafe Ole.

132
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,060
Regular coffee then

133
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,678
Oh! hold the spit please.

134
00:14:01,887 --> 00:14:04,032
Why do you pretend to come here
just for coffee?

135
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,248
I'm not pretending.

136
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:07,829
I like my coffee cheap and greasy.

137
00:14:08,844 --> 00:14:10,505
I can refuse service to anyone.

138
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:12,892
Still the American way.

139
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,533
When they are citizens.

140
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:16,855
Got your papers?

141
00:14:18,321 --> 00:14:19,837
Same as the last time you checked.

142
00:14:19,838 --> 00:14:21,856
And the time before that.

143
00:14:22,847 --> 00:14:23,935
And the time before that!

144
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:26,232
Got yours?

145
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,413
Same as the last time you checked.

146
00:14:29,682 --> 00:14:31,048
You think what you do is right?

147
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,732
Taking your brothers and sisters in?

148
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,116
Deporting them to their own
personal health?

149
00:14:36,117 --> 00:14:37,472
It's the law.

150
00:14:37,473 --> 00:14:38,713
There are many laws.

151
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:40,270
There sure are...

152
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,301
Immigration fraud...

153
00:14:42,302 --> 00:14:44,398
Aiding and illegal entry

154
00:14:45,108 --> 00:14:46,598
Insanitary food processing...

155
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:48,524
But you wouldn't know anything about that
would you?

156
00:14:49,011 --> 00:14:50,011
Can I get my taco's

157
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:56,171
Who's she?

158
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,966
I heard she runs an underground network.

159
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:00,841
How the hell would I know?

160
00:15:01,158 --> 00:15:02,899
I just make tacos and I sell them.

161
00:15:03,355 --> 00:15:04,823
To the workers of this site.

162
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,790
It fills their bellies other
than hate.

163
00:15:08,678 --> 00:15:09,678
Funny.

164
00:15:09,984 --> 00:15:11,599
Sounds like something she would say.

165
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:14,767
Catch you later.

166
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,379
In the race for State Senator...

167
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,556
Latest polls are showing...

168
00:15:21,557 --> 00:15:24,721
a sharp decline in support for incumbent
Senator John McLaughlin.

169
00:15:24,722 --> 00:15:26,699
And his hard-line position on immigration.

170
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:43,291
Get in.

171
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,095
Fellow dodged it forever.

172
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,110
125 perceptive.

173
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,125
Sewage.

174
00:15:53,563 --> 00:15:54,849
You ever killed anyone before?

175
00:16:34,778 --> 00:16:35,809
You know this guy?

176
00:16:40,163 --> 00:16:41,948
Senator John McLaughlin...

177
00:16:43,227 --> 00:16:45,096
Independent from cocksucker county.

178
00:16:45,663 --> 00:16:48,221
Built his reputation on being
a hardliner against wetbacks.

179
00:16:49,295 --> 00:16:50,345
Gets worse.

180
00:16:51,225 --> 00:16:54,771
Yes... If he has his brothers.
He'll send you back to old Mehico.

181
00:16:54,772 --> 00:16:56,496
That's his platform.

182
00:16:56,808 --> 00:17:00,440
Ship them all back before first making them
built a wall along the border for no pay.

183
00:17:01,012 --> 00:17:02,485
Thank you very much get the fuck out.

184
00:17:03,368 --> 00:17:04,829
But what the state senator fails to understand is...

185
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,021
the state runs the illegal labour.

186
00:17:07,022 --> 00:17:08,601
Thrives on it.

187
00:17:08,602 --> 00:17:10,567
Keeps costs down.

188
00:17:10,568 --> 00:17:11,568
Keeps the wheels turning.

189
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,799
We bust that up
and we're fucked.

190
00:17:15,152 --> 00:17:16,623
My words.

191
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:20,193
Now I'm guessing you don't
have papers.

192
00:17:20,813 --> 00:17:21,792
As you well know...

193
00:17:21,793 --> 00:17:23,218
illegal immigrants like yourself...

194
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:25,824
will be forced out of the
country in alarming numbers

195
00:17:27,664 --> 00:17:29,915
So for the sake of both
our people's.

196
00:17:32,578 --> 00:17:33,997
The senator must die.

197
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,874
And for that. I will give you
150 thousand dollars cash.

198
00:18:00,948 --> 00:18:02,199
Get someone else.

199
00:18:04,899 --> 00:18:05,838
No time.

200
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,374
This job has to happen tomorrow.

201
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:17,131
I want you to take this cash,
do the job and disappear.

202
00:18:18,523 --> 00:18:20,350
How long would it take you to get this kind of money?

203
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:24,759
5... 10... 15 years?

204
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:27,809
You can do a lot of good things with this.

205
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:30,323
You deserve it.

206
00:18:36,171 --> 00:18:37,378
Now I can't make you do this.

207
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:41,438
But I can make damn sure something
happens to you if you don't.

208
00:18:43,171 --> 00:18:44,048
Are you in?

209
00:18:50,068 --> 00:18:51,172
Have a look at this...

210
00:18:51,749 --> 00:18:54,424
Straight line design,

211
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,750
Laser designated scope.

212
00:18:55,898 --> 00:18:59,112
You can shoot the pecker off
a mosquito at a thousand yards.

213
00:19:00,535 --> 00:19:02,041
And keep the balls unruffled.

214
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:07,179
Machete?

215
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,132
That's only good if you wanna make a
brutal point.

216
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:11,924
But it's low tech. Completely
unsuited to our purposes.

217
00:19:12,214 --> 00:19:13,200
Backup...

218
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,127
Here's your backup.

219
00:19:15,597 --> 00:19:16,597
Me.

220
00:19:16,598 --> 00:19:18,253
You call or text if you have any problems,

221
00:19:18,254 --> 00:19:20,846
or delays. You need to be on that
roof by 1 pm sharp.

222
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,665
Now put a bullet in the senator
by 1:04pm.

223
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,579
Get up!

224
00:20:23,026 --> 00:20:24,026
God damn April.

225
00:20:24,027 --> 00:20:26,700
My business partner have very little tolerance
for bullshit.

226
00:20:32,576 --> 00:20:34,230
This is a second operation in the last six months,

227
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:36,084
that I have to close down
because of your mentally...

228
00:20:38,658 --> 00:20:39,655
I told you a thousand times.

229
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,886
You need something you come to me
directly.

230
00:20:45,115 --> 00:20:46,741
You do not go to these labs.

231
00:20:57,495 --> 00:20:58,613
You got something to say to me?

232
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,013
Sorry daddy.

233
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,098
What's this?

234
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:36,510
$150 thousand

235
00:21:36,511 --> 00:21:37,511
Cash.

236
00:21:38,795 --> 00:21:40,094
Are you out of your mind?

237
00:21:40,887 --> 00:21:42,399
The Network got me across once.

238
00:21:43,287 --> 00:21:44,333
Use this.

239
00:21:44,756 --> 00:21:46,134
For the people you help.

240
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:48,353
I don't know how you know what you know.

241
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,125
But I'm glad I know you.

242
00:21:55,717 --> 00:21:56,786
What'd you want?

243
00:21:58,434 --> 00:21:59,434
Here.

244
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:04,268
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Mr. Senator John McLaughlin.

245
00:22:08,153 --> 00:22:10,043
I want to thank you all for coming
out today!

246
00:22:10,965 --> 00:22:13,548
And I want to thank this forum from the bottom
of my heart.

247
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:20,002
Because we have been tested.

248
00:22:20,003 --> 00:22:21,997
Tested by fire!

249
00:22:21,788 --> 00:22:26,050
Our borders have been put to the test.
And let me tell you we have failed that test.

250
00:22:27,517 --> 00:22:30,008
The aliens,  the infiltrators, the outsiders...

251
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:31,603
They come right across by light of day,

252
00:22:31,604 --> 00:22:32,614
by dark at night.

253
00:22:32,615 --> 00:22:34,439
They'll bleed us. They'll parasites.

254
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,362
They'll bleed us til we're a city,

255
00:22:35,915 --> 00:22:36,915
a county, a state.

256
00:22:37,945 --> 00:22:39,899
a nation til we're all bled out.

257
00:22:41,614 --> 00:22:43,018
Now make no mistake
we are at war.

258
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:45,991
Every time an illegal dances across
our border.

259
00:22:45,992 --> 00:22:48,960
It is an act of aggression against
this sovereign state.

260
00:22:48,961 --> 00:22:50,607
A covert act of terrorism.

261
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:54,224
Everywhere I go in this glorious state.

262
00:22:54,225 --> 00:22:55,165
People are talking about change.

263
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,478
I say why change?

264
00:22:56,479 --> 00:23:00,066
This is a great state founded
on the principles of liberty.

265
00:23:01,192 --> 00:23:02,542
I don't want to change that.

266
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:05,975
Our rightful citizens are a hardworking Americans,

267
00:23:05,976 --> 00:23:07,347
who have earned their paychecks...

268
00:23:07,348 --> 00:23:09,463
by the grit of their gut and
the sweat of their brow!

269
00:23:11,321 --> 00:23:12,600
I don't want to change that!

270
00:23:13,717 --> 00:23:15,037
Change! That they want change!

271
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:16,216
Change the law!

272
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:17,125
Open the doors!

273
00:23:17,126 --> 00:23:18,834
Red rover! Red rover!

274
00:23:18,835 --> 00:23:20,426
Let the terrorist come over!

275
00:23:21,876 --> 00:23:23,804
Let me tell you what change that will bring!

276
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:25,930
68 cents!

277
00:23:26,992 --> 00:23:28,624
The jingle jangle of the pennies in your pocket.

278
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:31,666
Because the scavengers, the leeches,
the parasites,

279
00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:33,210
are walking away with your money.

280
00:23:33,927 --> 00:23:36,628
While you're left with the change.

281
00:23:38,397 --> 00:23:40,183
So I wanna say one more thing.

282
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,252
Who you gonna vote for?

283
00:23:58,277 --> 00:23:59,154
There!

284
00:23:59,155 --> 00:24:01,078
Up there! I saw someone shot from up there!

285
00:24:03,173 --> 00:24:04,173
Get him to Fort Briggs!

286
00:24:11,795 --> 00:24:12,795
Roger! I'm on my way.

287
00:24:27,608 --> 00:24:28,608
Go ahead.

288
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,640
Shoot him Nacho.

289
00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:31,860
Cos right after that.

290
00:24:33,076 --> 00:24:34,076
The three of us

291
00:24:34,591 --> 00:24:35,591
Are gonna shoot one of you.

292
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,564
Shit!

293
00:24:54,188 --> 00:24:55,188
Try it.

294
00:24:55,852 --> 00:24:56,852
Go ahead... Pacho.

295
00:24:57,959 --> 00:25:00,565
I'll grease your chips all
over this fucking alley.

296
00:25:06,622 --> 00:25:07,882
This is fucking big.

297
00:25:08,336 --> 00:25:09,990
This guy took a shot at a representative.

298
00:25:09,991 --> 00:25:10,991
No! A Senator.

299
00:25:10,992 --> 00:25:12,027
This is fucking high.

300
00:25:12,028 --> 00:25:13,982
The guy can die and we caught him.

301
00:25:13,983 --> 00:25:14,983
Hell we did!

302
00:25:15,844 --> 00:25:18,144
And they'll gonna hang your ass
like Saddam!

303
00:25:18,615 --> 00:25:20,577
Look I'm gonna call the boss
unless you wanna do it.

304
00:25:20,961 --> 00:25:21,943
Yeah, you go ahead.

305
00:25:21,944 --> 00:25:24,665
We got the Mexican bird that fell off the rooftop!

306
00:25:26,188 --> 00:25:27,548
Bring him to the basement.

307
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,481
He stills thinks we're cops.

308
00:25:31,482 --> 00:25:33,208
Well of course he will think that.

309
00:25:33,721 --> 00:25:35,836
We frisked him, we cuffed him, we
throw him in the car.

310
00:25:35,837 --> 00:25:38,697
Apprehended him just like the
real cops do.

311
00:25:40,866 --> 00:25:43,219
I didn't frisked him.

312
00:25:42,735 --> 00:25:43,558
Yes, you did.

313
00:25:43,727 --> 00:25:44,727
Man, I'm telling you I didn’t...

314
00:25:45,603 --> 00:25:47,773
Oh! Sweet Jesus.

315
00:25:54,201 --> 00:25:56,694
Oh! DAMN!

316
00:26:06,428 --> 00:26:07,428
Shocking news this hour.

317
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:11,689
Senator John McLaughlin was shot
in the leg this afternoon by an unknown gunman.

318
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:14,425
The Senator was immediately driven to Parklane hospital,

319
00:26:14,426 --> 00:26:17,216
where he was reportedly in good and
stable condition.

320
00:26:17,217 --> 00:26:21,496
Video taken at the rally indicate the
gunman may have been of Mexican descent.

321
00:26:22,724 --> 00:26:25,159
Senator McLaughlin have been
very vocal against immigration.

322
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,539
And campaigns for stricter border patrols.

323
00:26:43,024 --> 00:26:44,024
Boss.

324
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:45,341
Video.

325
00:26:47,984 --> 00:26:49,537
You see what I am sending you Mr. Torrez.

326
00:26:49,538 --> 00:26:51,735
It's coming on my screen now.

327
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:53,648
That's campaign gold.

328
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:58,696
I put my contributions were for the Senator's re-election.

329
00:26:58,697 --> 00:26:59,697
Not his retirement.

330
00:26:59,698 --> 00:27:02,000
McLaughlin is in a guaranteed win.

331
00:27:02,001 --> 00:27:03,801
And in a new session as promised,

332
00:27:03,802 --> 00:27:06,305
he'll ramrod through everything we asked for.

333
00:27:06,827 --> 00:27:07,827
Pause!

334
00:27:08,256 --> 00:27:09,256
Go back.

335
00:27:12,153 --> 00:27:13,153
Who's this?

336
00:27:13,154 --> 00:27:14,154
Nobody.

337
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:15,918
A day labourer from the streets.

338
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:16,959
He won't be missed.

339
00:27:17,835 --> 00:27:18,549
Is he dead?

340
00:27:19,308 --> 00:27:21,294
Dead or dying on a rooftop.
That's what you mean.

341
00:27:21,295 --> 00:27:22,884
What the fuck is it! Asshole...

342
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,115
Dead or dying?

343
00:27:25,205 --> 00:27:27,963
He'll be dead within minutes.
I guarantee.

344
00:27:30,188 --> 00:27:31,919
For your sake.

345
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:37,066
What?

346
00:27:38,785 --> 00:27:41,676
It's me. It's done. I think he's toast.

347
00:27:42,262 --> 00:27:44,012
Don't think! Verify! Check the
morgue,

348
00:27:44,013 --> 00:27:45,828
check the hospitals, check everywhere.

349
00:27:49,724 --> 00:27:52,764
Most do not give illegals
standard treatment in hospitals.

350
00:27:52,884 --> 00:27:54,484
But thou art with us.

351
00:27:54,564 --> 00:27:56,804
Nobody knows you're here.

352
00:27:56,844 --> 00:28:00,099
You were brought here under the name John Doe,

353
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,510
as a mere spectator.

354
00:28:05,011 --> 00:28:05,839
Is that him?
Yes.

355
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,613
Dr. Felix wants to see him.

356
00:28:08,468 --> 00:28:09,209
Quietly...

357
00:28:11,054 --> 00:28:12,515
Did you see where the bullet rebound.

358
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:15,053
It was stopped by another bullet that
was fused and lodged there.

359
00:28:15,054 --> 00:28:17,351
If he hadn't been shot before.
He'll be dead now.

360
00:28:17,891 --> 00:28:19,719
There's actually a lesson in there somewhere .

361
00:28:20,537 --> 00:28:22,280
I can feel your eyeballs on my uterus.

362
00:28:22,281 --> 00:28:24,176
Woah, woah, woah, at least it's not on your colon.

363
00:28:24,177 --> 00:28:25,860
Well, actually did you know that the...

364
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:28,740
the human intestines is ten times longer
than the length of the body?

365
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:29,741
Wait!

366
00:28:29,742 --> 00:28:31,756
So the human intestines is
60 feet long?

367
00:28:31,757 --> 00:28:32,757
It's true.

368
00:28:34,554 --> 00:28:35,638
The hero has awoken!

369
00:28:37,357 --> 00:28:40,560
My friend! You are safe, they are
from The Network.

370
00:28:40,561 --> 00:28:42,789
They will take good care of you.

371
00:28:43,915 --> 00:28:44,915
Leave him alone.

372
00:28:48,095 --> 00:28:49,558
Hello, what can I do for you?

373
00:28:50,196 --> 00:28:51,084
What can you do for me?

374
00:28:51,085 --> 00:28:53,390
I'm looking for a gentleman
that was just brought in.

375
00:28:53,391 --> 00:28:55,691
Probably into ICU.

376
00:28:56,606 --> 00:28:57,710
Where might I find him?

377
00:28:58,624 --> 00:29:00,437
You wanna go straight down
the hall, to your right...

378
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,814
Make a left, two rights and another left.

379
00:29:03,815 --> 00:29:04,806
And you'll be right there.

380
00:29:07,608 --> 00:29:08,410
You sure about that?

381
00:29:13,481 --> 00:29:14,713
I'm going this way.

382
00:29:17,195 --> 00:29:18,234
Someone is coming.

383
00:29:19,286 --> 00:29:20,069
We got trouble.

384
00:29:33,986 --> 00:29:35,154
Got another way outta here?

385
00:29:35,155 --> 00:29:36,155
No other exits.

386
00:29:37,224 --> 00:29:38,276
Oh... you don't wanna mess with that.

387
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:39,570
That's a skull scraper.

388
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:40,898
We use that to scrape the bones clean.

389
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,745
And those can cut through flesh
just like butter.

390
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:49,820
Pass that tank.

391
00:30:49,817 --> 00:30:50,817
Hold it!

392
00:31:27,994 --> 00:31:29,190
Boss ain't gonna like this.

393
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,409
What are we gonna tell him?

394
00:31:33,501 --> 00:31:34,337
Ooops.

395
00:32:00,927 --> 00:32:01,927
Evana.

396
00:32:02,543 --> 00:32:03,418
I'm on my lunch break sir.

397
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:05,135
Lunch break is over. All hell's breaking loose,

398
00:32:05,136 --> 00:32:07,058
Some took a shot at Senator McLaughlin.

399
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:08,308
It was a illegal.

400
00:32:08,247 --> 00:32:09,637
I'm watching it right now.

401
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:11,893
This amateur video was taken just outside
county hospital,

402
00:32:11,894 --> 00:32:14,692
just after the failed attempt to
assassinate Senator John McLaughlin.

403
00:32:14,693 --> 00:32:16,987
Authorities believe that this suspect
is extremely dangerous...

404
00:32:16,988 --> 00:32:18,329
Son of a bitch...

405
00:32:19,046 --> 00:32:19,974
No! not you sir.

406
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:22,470
I've seen him before.

407
00:32:23,511 --> 00:32:24,594
Yes sir. I'm on my way.

408
00:32:24,911 --> 00:32:26,280
He maybe in this country illegally.

409
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:30,146
And that he is of course to be considered
to be armed and extremely dangerous.

410
00:32:35,597 --> 00:32:38,334
You're all over the TV! Cabron!
Come on get inside!

411
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,920
Hurry!

412
00:32:42,067 --> 00:32:43,958
The shots fired on Senator
McLaughlin today maybe,

413
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:46,874
just the shot in the arm
his campaign needed.

414
00:32:47,155 --> 00:32:49,831
New numbers indicate that he has
now taken a commanding,

415
00:32:49,832 --> 00:32:51,985
led from the wake of today's incident.

416
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:54,098
Since today's shooting. Others agree that

417
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:56,496
border security should be heavily enforced.

418
00:32:56,879 --> 00:32:59,822
Yes, hold the illegals responsible!
Close the border!

419
00:33:00,202 --> 00:33:01,398
Eh... yeah!

420
00:33:02,491 --> 00:33:04,632
Didn't you cross the border to
get here Jack?

421
00:33:05,044 --> 00:33:08,023
Well, we're almost there.
If they close the border, fine by me.

422
00:33:08,493 --> 00:33:09,651
Nocha!

423
00:33:10,284 --> 00:33:12,484
"Cona" Opinions should be like.

424
00:33:13,675 --> 00:33:14,957
Waay!

425
00:33:18,313 --> 00:33:20,627
You didn't have a choice,
Of course I believe you.

426
00:33:21,572 --> 00:33:23,091
why else would you give me the money?

427
00:33:23,792 --> 00:33:25,338
They'll be looking  for your ass.

428
00:33:28,182 --> 00:33:29,566
You'll be safe here.

429
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:33,441
Try not to bleed on the bed.

430
00:33:57,263 --> 00:34:00,105
Are you "She"?

431
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,844
"She" brings hope.

432
00:34:05,845 --> 00:34:07,582
"She" rights the wrongs.

433
00:34:09,178 --> 00:34:12,458
Unfortunately, "She's" a myth.

434
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:15,073
Just someone I made up to
led The Network.

435
00:34:16,616 --> 00:34:18,912
At first, I just wanted to help
people get settled,

436
00:34:20,542 --> 00:34:22,449
give them food, find them work.

437
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,644
Now there's a war
against us.

438
00:34:24,456 --> 00:34:26,901
Von and his border vigilantes.

439
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,359
Hunting us down like dogs.

440
00:34:29,665 --> 00:34:30,834
And there's no one there to stop them.

441
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:31,521
You can...

442
00:34:33,945 --> 00:34:35,305
You're a fighter

443
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:38,414
Only when there is something
worth fighting for.

444
00:34:41,376 --> 00:34:42,378
Is there?

445
00:34:45,518 --> 00:34:46,538
Always.

446
00:34:57,307 --> 00:34:59,272
When the sun rises, you should be good.

447
00:35:01,655 --> 00:35:04,089
Don't start something
that you can't finish.

448
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:06,700
Machete.

449
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:08,557
You know me?

450
00:35:09,342 --> 00:35:10,342
I know the legend.

451
00:35:12,255 --> 00:35:14,127
Maybe the legend's better.

452
00:35:20,058 --> 00:35:21,260
I'll be the judge of that.

453
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,585
Where are you? Mr. Mysterious?

454
00:36:06,346 --> 00:36:07,328
Oh my god...

455
00:36:09,563 --> 00:36:12,094
Codename: Machete
Former Federal.

456
00:36:12,311 --> 00:36:13,666
Gunning the Senator down in the street!

457
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,026
What on earth were they thinking?

458
00:36:15,727 --> 00:36:18,910
Sometimes I worry about April and
what kinda world we're living here.

459
00:36:21,008 --> 00:36:22,527
A fucked up world.

460
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,239
I'd ought to wash your mouth out with soap.

461
00:36:24,987 --> 00:36:26,482
Give me another that taco.

462
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,830
Someone took a shot at a senator.
What world would you call it?

463
00:36:28,831 --> 00:36:30,345
A fucked up world.

464
00:36:31,334 --> 00:36:32,809
Like two peas in a pod.

465
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:34,859
So! Hmm...

466
00:36:33,223 --> 00:36:36,973
I think David is going to ask me
to marry him.

467
00:36:39,653 --> 00:36:41,317
But I have my priorities.

468
00:36:41,322 --> 00:36:42,237
School and a career.

469
00:36:42,529 --> 00:36:43,529
Salsa!

470
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:45,828
Actually I was thinking more
about my modeling.

471
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:49,118
You are a very pretty girl April,

472
00:36:50,525 --> 00:36:51,920
but that's tough enough to crack.

473
00:36:52,766 --> 00:36:54,577
I know all about cracking nuts.

474
00:36:58,855 --> 00:37:00,710
Do you even know how many hits I
get on my website?

475
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,264
You own a website? She has a
website? Did you know about this?

476
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:06,022
I know all about what the online public wants.

477
00:37:06,595 --> 00:37:07,668
And they want ME!

478
00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:08,779
All of ME!

479
00:37:11,848 --> 00:37:13,936
That does it. I'm sending
you to a convent.

480
00:37:15,463 --> 00:37:16,177
What?

481
00:37:16,029 --> 00:37:17,929
He's loose. He got away.

482
00:37:18,016 --> 00:37:20,715
God Damn! How hard is it for you to kill a
god damn day labourer?

483
00:37:20,716 --> 00:37:22,545
You get to that corner where I
picked him up.

484
00:37:22,546 --> 00:37:23,546
You find him!

485
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:24,790
Do IT!

486
00:37:35,942 --> 00:37:37,492
Seen a big wagon?

487
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:40,631
No... No speak english.

488
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,013
Speak. 45?

489
00:37:45,002 --> 00:37:46,802
Where's the tacos truck lady at?

490
00:37:48,401 --> 00:37:51,529
Hey! I don't know man. I haven't seen
her this morning. She's late.

491
00:37:52,787 --> 00:37:54,416
She...

492
00:37:57,794 --> 00:37:59,341
You know where you lives...

493
00:38:48,322 --> 00:38:49,787
Alright... go get him.

494
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,466
You're all over the god damn TV.

495
00:40:05,271 --> 00:40:07,053
Get in!

496
00:40:07,702 --> 00:40:08,756
Agent

497
00:40:11,937 --> 00:40:14,437
You're the second beautiful
girl that picked me up today.

498
00:40:20,278 --> 00:40:21,278
Exploding houses!

499
00:40:21,501 --> 00:40:22,501
Bodies falling from the sky!

500
00:40:23,483 --> 00:40:25,222
Jesus Christ Machete...

501
00:40:25,302 --> 00:40:26,950
You're a walking SHIT MAGNET!

502
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,549
Ya! I know who you are...

503
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,336
I'm Santana Evira.

504
00:40:32,147 --> 00:40:33,804
Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE).

505
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:35,468
ICE.

506
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:37,717
Fuckin' A! La Migra (immigration)...

507
00:40:38,198 --> 00:40:41,177
Don't worry, I won't ship you back,
if you tell me what I need to know.

508
00:40:40,977 --> 00:40:42,322
Working my way up.

509
00:40:42,323 --> 00:40:44,955
I can't be busting people like tacos
stands anymore.

510
00:40:44,956 --> 00:40:46,898
Well, I'm probably related to half of them.

511
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,859
You need me more than I need you.

512
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:50,006
Come on.

513
00:40:50,007 --> 00:40:53,854
You know all the cops in this
state are hunting you down for trying to kill a senator.

514
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,979
I wasn't gonna kill him.

515
00:40:57,193 --> 00:40:58,298
Just gonna shoot him in the neck,

516
00:40:58,299 --> 00:41:00,838
Stop him from saying all those
stupid things.

517
00:41:01,097 --> 00:41:02,641
It was a set up.

518
00:41:03,074 --> 00:41:04,346
There was another shooter there.

519
00:41:04,461 --> 00:41:05,600
There was another shooter?

520
00:41:05,601 --> 00:41:06,601
Who?

521
00:41:16,395 --> 00:41:17,385
Drive!

522
00:41:19,712 --> 00:41:20,673
Drive.

523
00:41:26,828 --> 00:41:29,179
I know what they did to your family.

524
00:41:29,351 --> 00:41:31,089
And if I were you I wouldn't trust
anyone neither,

525
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,362
but it's different here.

526
00:41:32,861 --> 00:41:34,413
Laws are enforced.

527
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,651
And people control them.
Not drug lords.

528
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,039
The system works here...

529
00:41:41,141 --> 00:41:42,141
Says you.

530
00:41:42,271 --> 00:41:45,140
I started working on the night shift
taking out the trash.

531
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,275
But I worked my way up.

532
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,971
As translator, assistant...

533
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,784
Now I'm special agent in
charge of investigations.

534
00:41:54,308 --> 00:41:57,146
Sounds like they still got you
taking out the trash.

535
00:41:57,721 --> 00:41:59,249
Let me take you in...

536
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,411
Put you into witness protection.

537
00:42:02,018 --> 00:42:05,358
All you got to do is tell me who
hired you to take out the senator.

538
00:42:13,325 --> 00:42:14,360
Fine.

539
00:42:16,685 --> 00:42:19,056
Holy Shit.

540
00:42:20,023 --> 00:42:23,909
You mean to tell me that a Mexican daily is a
god damn federale?

541
00:42:23,854 --> 00:42:28,909
That's right, CIA, FBI, DEA, all
rolled in one mean fucking burrito.

542
00:42:29,094 --> 00:42:31,316
Is this the man who you assigned to kill Machete?

543
00:42:32,605 --> 00:42:33,650
Yes.

544
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,619
And so far you failed.

545
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:39,268
So far.

546
00:42:39,979 --> 00:42:43,173
I'm sorry to see you have a high tolerance
for failure Bon nita.

547
00:42:43,731 --> 00:42:44,980
I don't...

548
00:42:57,824 --> 00:42:58,744
not bad

549
00:42:59,002 --> 00:43:00,726
The last time we spoke you could have mentioned
that he was a god damn federale!

550
00:43:00,727 --> 00:43:01,727
God Dammit!

551
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:04,416
Notoriously is hard to kill,
trust me.

552
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:05,417
I've tried.

553
00:43:06,474 --> 00:43:08,203
Well, you didn't try with the guy I'm calling in.

554
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:12,055
The very best the great state of Texas has to offer.

555
00:43:13,464 --> 00:43:16,633
Osiris Amanpour.

556
00:43:16,998 --> 00:43:18,776
If Machete is captured alive.

557
00:43:18,777 --> 00:43:21,843
He'll expose my entire operation.

558
00:43:22,627 --> 00:43:24,713
You have 24 hours take him down,

559
00:43:24,714 --> 00:43:26,248
or I'll come over there myself...

560
00:43:26,999 --> 00:43:29,155
And I'll kill him myself.

561
00:43:36,538 --> 00:43:39,250
Sorry, my friend.

562
00:43:41,367 --> 00:43:44,650
My grandfather always says you
can solve any problem with food.

563
00:43:45,355 --> 00:43:46,485
And you my friend,

564
00:43:47,694 --> 00:43:49,323
have plenty of problems.

565
00:43:51,926 --> 00:43:53,696
So who you working for?

566
00:43:54,138 --> 00:43:55,527
Who wants the senator dead?

567
00:43:55,569 --> 00:43:56,784
Is it The Network?

568
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:58,434
Luz?

569
00:43:58,435 --> 00:43:59,596
She doesn't know anything about it.

570
00:44:01,054 --> 00:44:02,039
Network either.

571
00:44:02,498 --> 00:44:03,895
The man who hired me...

572
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:04,851
was a Mexican.

573
00:44:05,186 --> 00:44:06,114
Really

574
00:44:07,371 --> 00:44:09,784
So he was just a random guy who says...

575
00:44:09,785 --> 00:44:11,475
hey, wanna kill the senator today?

576
00:44:12,047 --> 00:44:13,127
And you are like cool?

577
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:16,092
I was afraid he wanted receptive work.

578
00:44:16,093 --> 00:44:20,156
Instead, he offered me $150,000
to kill the senator.

579
00:44:20,796 --> 00:44:21,939
That's a lot of money.

580
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:23,939
So that's why you did it?

581
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:27,111
For the money.

582
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:29,727
Look, Machete.

583
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:34,038
You're not legal in this country.

584
00:44:34,861 --> 00:44:37,979
And after what happened in Mexico
there is no way you're going home.

585
00:44:38,985 --> 00:44:40,866
So basically, you're a man with no country.

586
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:45,422
And lucky for you. I can help you out.

587
00:44:45,717 --> 00:44:46,678
Look at me.

588
00:44:48,216 --> 00:44:49,561
I can get you papers.

589
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:53,509
But you've got to let me bring you in.

590
00:45:01,845 --> 00:45:03,970
I'm gonna find the guy who did this.

591
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:07,427
And bring him to you.

592
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,697
Why should I trust you?

593
00:45:16,694 --> 00:45:18,490
Because we are both cops.

594
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:25,863
I'd tell you to stop, but
I know you took the bullets.

595
00:45:36,122 --> 00:45:37,122
Luz!

596
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:38,710
Luz!

597
00:45:40,477 --> 00:45:42,869
You wouldn't think they'll take me down
that easily did ya?

598
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:47,146
You're alive.
But your house man!

599
00:45:46,924 --> 00:45:48,753
It was small...

600
00:45:50,085 --> 00:45:51,564
I've got something to show you guys,
come on...

601
00:46:03,822 --> 00:46:05,611
Told you they were gunning for us.

602
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:07,860
Who knows what they'll gonna do next.

603
00:46:08,592 --> 00:46:10,489
Holy shit, Luz!

604
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:11,927
I didn't now that you were this loaded.

605
00:46:11,928 --> 00:46:13,754
You got more heat than the Popos (police).

606
00:46:13,892 --> 00:46:16,494
It's a good start, but we need a lot more.

607
00:46:16,155 --> 00:46:17,206
Need it for what?

608
00:46:17,761 --> 00:46:19,824
La Revoluzion. (The Revolution).

609
00:46:20,355 --> 00:46:22,393
Van and his men are coming for us.

610
00:46:22,616 --> 00:46:23,950
We need to be ready.

611
00:46:24,132 --> 00:46:25,451
I'm not gonna be around forever.

612
00:46:26,026 --> 00:46:30,286
If anything happens, you need to tell Machete
the people need him.

613
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,056
Who exactly is this Machete?

614
00:46:34,286 --> 00:46:36,049
That's him...

615
00:46:37,396 --> 00:46:38,601
he's the one.

616
00:46:38,804 --> 00:46:39,919
Hands up!

617
00:46:40,648 --> 00:46:41,648
Against the wall.

618
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,872
All of you, move it!

619
00:46:48,197 --> 00:46:49,469
Where's Machete?

620
00:46:49,735 --> 00:46:51,099
Shit. She knows. Man!

621
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,100
Amigo's gonna deport our ass back.

622
00:46:53,467 --> 00:46:54,990
Nobodies deporting anybody.

623
00:46:54,991 --> 00:46:57,688
Machete already told me you guys weren't
involved in the shooting.

624
00:46:57,789 --> 00:47:02,521
Although... I should probably
check the "carnitas".

625
00:47:03,826 --> 00:47:04,841
For lead!

626
00:47:05,577 --> 00:47:07,078
What is this place anyway?

627
00:47:14,671 --> 00:47:16,371
Welcome to The Network.

628
00:47:17,016 --> 00:47:18,535
These are some of the people that I've help.

629
00:47:19,062 --> 00:47:20,847
Help them cross,

630
00:47:20,848 --> 00:47:22,307
Got them jobs,

631
00:47:22,666 --> 00:47:24,431
then make sure that they do their part.

632
00:47:24,989 --> 00:47:26,893
And this?

633
00:47:27,393 --> 00:47:29,050
These are the guys trying to stop us.

634
00:47:29,077 --> 00:47:32,055
Van Jackson and his Border Vigilantes.

635
00:47:32,257 --> 00:47:35,672
They started off with a couple of deer rifles
and a warped sense of justice.

636
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:37,389
Then in the last year they've grown.

637
00:47:38,018 --> 00:47:39,780
More guns, more men.

638
00:47:40,234 --> 00:47:41,387
Who's funding them?

639
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,180
Whoever it is, is making a mess
of our operation.

640
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:46,229
And these?

641
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:49,578
Missing

642
00:47:51,094 --> 00:47:54,107
They are supposed to have crossed.
But I have no way to track them.

643
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,852
How deep does your operation go?

644
00:47:55,853 --> 00:47:56,853
Deep.

645
00:47:57,391 --> 00:48:02,185
All types, all races.
Lawyers, priests, doctors, homeboys...

646
00:48:03,084 --> 00:48:04,846
That's why they call it "The Network".

647
00:48:05,109 --> 00:48:07,795
The way we see it.
People risk everything to get here.

648
00:48:09,731 --> 00:48:11,179
The system doesn't work.

649
00:48:11,949 --> 00:48:12,910
It's broken.

650
00:48:14,044 --> 00:48:15,815
So we created our own.

651
00:48:18,455 --> 00:48:19,795
You gonna burn us? huh?

652
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,257
Turn us all in?

653
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:22,640
no

654
00:48:24,249 --> 00:48:27,367
I'm gonna walk away and pretend
I didn't see any of this.

655
00:48:27,849 --> 00:48:29,482
Tell Machete I'm looking for him!

656
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:43,888
I am a man of faith,

657
00:48:44,477 --> 00:48:45,792
I took a vow of peace.

658
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,270
And I don't shoot anymore.

659
00:48:48,311 --> 00:48:49,810
And you don't shoot any less either.

660
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:53,186
I don't see you or heard
from you in three years,

661
00:48:53,475 --> 00:48:56,069
And now you want me to
help you kill all these men?

662
00:48:57,289 --> 00:48:59,118
Yes, brother...

663
00:48:59,888 --> 00:49:01,522
I mean, Padre (Father).

664
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:07,776
I'll see what I can do.

665
00:49:09,588 --> 00:49:13,048
I want you to say 10 our fathers
and 10 hail marys.

666
00:49:13,196 --> 00:49:15,609
Light a candle for mom...

667
00:49:17,628 --> 00:49:20,030
For funerals.
A little side business.

668
00:49:23,781 --> 00:49:27,494
I have these installed when too many things
started walking away from the altar and collection plates.

669
00:49:27,495 --> 00:49:30,666
Imagine if we have these kinda setup
for all the federales.

670
00:49:30,868 --> 00:49:32,271
This is how you get the bad guys now.

671
00:49:32,272 --> 00:49:33,639
You catch them on video.

672
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,629
Cuban?

673
00:49:37,603 --> 00:49:38,657
Mexican.

674
00:49:39,014 --> 00:49:40,418
Yeah, I got some of that.

675
00:49:46,531 --> 00:49:47,716
I've got something I want you to see

676
00:49:47,717 --> 00:49:49,722
Rest assure he will be caught.

677
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:53,157
It is the first shot of the war that...

678
00:49:53,158 --> 00:49:54,363
we didn't ask for.

679
00:49:54,689 --> 00:49:56,591
Nice way to find out your brother's in town.

680
00:49:58,121 --> 00:49:59,120
Right there.

681
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:02,110
That's the guy that hired me.

682
00:50:02,311 --> 00:50:03,364
Michael Booth?

683
00:50:04,591 --> 00:50:05,996
He's McLaughlin's aid or some shit.

684
00:50:08,911 --> 00:50:09,931
You know him?

685
00:50:10,253 --> 00:50:13,356
Yeah... he comes in for confession
all the time.

686
00:50:13,496 --> 00:50:15,987
Lots of impure thoughts.

687
00:50:15,988 --> 00:50:17,909
Mostly about his daughter.

688
00:50:18,985 --> 00:50:20,614
I guess I'm cheaper than a shrink (psychiatrist).

689
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:22,831
Here's his file.

690
00:50:23,065 --> 00:50:25,390
Once he started talking about
his connection to the cartels.

691
00:50:25,391 --> 00:50:27,050
I figured. It'll come in handy.

692
00:50:26,779 --> 00:50:29,402
I bet McLaughlin
doesn't even know that most of Booth's,

693
00:50:29,403 --> 00:50:31,902
business are just a
front for his drug trade.

694
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:36,505
What I don't understand is why he
hired you to kill his own boss.

695
00:50:36,214 --> 00:50:37,175
Don't know.

696
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,005
Gonna find out.

697
00:50:40,241 --> 00:50:42,096
It's not safe for you to be here.

698
00:50:42,648 --> 00:50:43,622
Not looking for safe.

699
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,386
No I mean it's not safe
for me for YOU to be here.

700
00:50:45,828 --> 00:50:46,847
I absolve you of all your sins,

701
00:50:46,848 --> 00:50:47,848
Now get the fuck out!

702
00:50:48,999 --> 00:50:49,960
Okay, bro...

703
00:50:52,402 --> 00:50:53,722
But I'm borrowing your car.

704
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:08,738
Why are you complaining about a weak neck,

705
00:51:08,739 --> 00:51:10,944
I'd said you should fucking do some sit-ups.

706
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,883
Hey... hey, hey boss?

707
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:15,062
Who're you?

708
00:51:16,402 --> 00:51:17,863
The new gardener

709
00:51:18,797 --> 00:51:19,997
Gardener?

710
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:31,800
I'm just fucking with you, chief.

711
00:51:31,801 --> 00:51:34,299
It's Hungarian, it means
that I'll kill you, you little monkey.

712
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,418
You know what?

713
00:51:36,419 --> 00:51:37,942
You can go clean that up. Alright!

714
00:51:34,779 --> 00:51:35,779
There is a large pile
shit in the back.

715
00:51:38,817 --> 00:51:40,258
Make sure you do a good job.

716
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,466
Make sure you wipe those boots off!

717
00:51:44,776 --> 00:51:46,218
He's carrying shit in the house.

718
00:51:47,276 --> 00:51:48,668
Did you ever notice that you let go
Mexicans into your home...

719
00:51:48,669 --> 00:51:51,024
just because he's got
gardening tools?

720
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:51,829
I mean, no questions asked.

721
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:52,715
You just let him right in.

722
00:51:55,464 --> 00:51:57,783
He could have a chainsaw
or a machete...

723
00:52:01,889 --> 00:52:03,518
God! Jesus!

724
00:52:17,177 --> 00:52:18,042
Stop it!

725
00:52:21,598 --> 00:52:22,559
Dammit, that hurts!

726
00:52:37,777 --> 00:52:39,800
If your father ever saw me, 2 minutes.

727
00:52:40,412 --> 00:52:41,662
Mom, everyone is gonna see you do this.

728
00:52:41,663 --> 00:52:42,663
it's the internet.

729
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:46,357
This is what my viewers wanna see online.

730
00:52:49,919 --> 00:52:52,283
Hey! You not the usual guy.

731
00:52:53,429 --> 00:52:54,597
He looks good to me.

732
00:52:56,293 --> 00:52:57,403
Oh don't be shy, come on in!

733
00:53:36,873 --> 00:53:37,852
Access denied.

734
00:53:52,882 --> 00:53:54,364
What the fuck did you bring them here for?

735
00:53:54,365 --> 00:53:55,870
Didn't you hear a god damn word I said?

736
00:53:56,686 --> 00:53:57,199
Want me to dump them?

737
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:58,568
What? No... no.

738
00:53:59,162 --> 00:54:00,162
I would make good use of them.

739
00:53:59,283 --> 00:54:03,281
The Church can always use good people.

740
00:54:15,008 --> 00:54:15,996
June?

741
00:54:17,692 --> 00:54:18,718
April?

742
00:54:50,837 --> 00:54:52,599
Where's my wife and daughter?

743
00:54:52,833 --> 00:54:54,528
Woah... one family at a time.

744
00:54:54,762 --> 00:54:55,585
It's Osiris...

745
00:54:56,401 --> 00:54:58,521
Machete has a Amano (brother)..

746
00:54:59,198 --> 00:55:02,080
or should I say, Padre (Father).

747
00:55:04,112 --> 00:55:08,405
State Senator John McLaughlin took a
vow to defend the Constitution of this State.

748
00:55:08,542 --> 00:55:09,507
Now!

749
00:55:10,797 --> 00:55:12,594
he's taken a bullet for us.

750
00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:19,442
And this is that bullet.

751
00:55:19,705 --> 00:55:22,250
Vote to re-elect Sen. John McLaughlin.

752
00:55:22,648 --> 00:55:25,123
I'm John McLaughlin
and I approve of this message.

753
00:55:25,259 --> 00:55:28,239
Paid for by the Committee to
re-elect of John McLaughlin.

754
00:55:50,148 --> 00:55:50,715
Sorry ma'am.

755
00:55:52,179 --> 00:55:53,179
Damn new phone.

756
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:54,640
Should put on the vibrator.

757
00:55:56,323 --> 00:55:57,305
Can you help me do that?

758
00:55:58,852 --> 00:55:59,834
Pervert.

759
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:04,603
Yeah?

760
00:56:04,604 --> 00:56:05,242
Senator?

761
00:56:06,097 --> 00:56:07,097
It's Van.

762
00:56:07,852 --> 00:56:10,872
I hear you got a problem maybe we can fix.

763
00:56:11,023 --> 00:56:13,426
Don't call me on this line again.
I'll call you.

764
00:56:13,029 --> 00:56:15,423
Now you said it yourself Senator
war has begun.

765
00:56:16,197 --> 00:56:17,932
Helter Skelter is here.

766
00:56:18,363 --> 00:56:20,466
Your army awaits further orders.

767
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,332
Got to be respectful now.

768
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:23,389
No shit slaves.

769
00:56:25,769 --> 00:56:26,786
What about the shooter?

770
00:56:26,787 --> 00:56:28,407
He's still out there?

771
00:56:32,243 --> 00:56:36,919
There's nothing I'd like more, then to see that Mexican dance the bolero with the end of the rope.

772
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:39,774
He's gone underground for sure.

773
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,164
Let's say we go underground.

774
00:56:41,885 --> 00:56:42,651
And get him.

775
00:56:43,267 --> 00:56:45,404
You find the Network and you
find the shooter.

776
00:56:45,464 --> 00:56:46,435
Call our special friend.

777
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:48,803
Tell him we're gonna need a helluva more firepower.

778
00:56:48,804 --> 00:56:51,520
If he is serious about wanting
that border shut down.

779
00:56:52,629 --> 00:56:54,263
Fix your damn gun.

780
00:56:54,817 --> 00:56:55,778
Thanks.

781
00:56:59,175 --> 00:57:01,619
Our friend is up.

782
00:57:13,446 --> 00:57:15,176
Where the fuck have you been?

783
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:18,320
You could at least texted me.

784
00:57:19,338 --> 00:57:21,559
Machete don't text.

785
00:57:24,836 --> 00:57:26,700
But Machete get evidence.

786
00:57:32,784 --> 00:57:34,939
Thanks for coming back.

787
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:40,058
There is no way that McLaughlin
is getting elected, unless something big happens.

788
00:57:40,325 --> 00:57:43,689
Can you imagine if someone shot the senator,
and that someone was a Mexican.

789
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:45,635
The public would elect him to be president.

790
00:57:46,022 --> 00:57:49,531
It's not a sin if someone clinch
the senator in the leg is it?

791
00:57:49,673 --> 00:57:51,686
So, this is footage from your brother's confession?

792
00:57:51,687 --> 00:57:54,961
There's no open commandant against thou shall
not wing a man.

793
00:57:54,962 --> 00:57:55,962
Is there Padre?

794
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,455
But these files over here.

795
00:57:57,456 --> 00:57:59,000
You got from Booth's office.

796
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:00,469
They're encrypted.

797
00:58:02,741 --> 00:58:05,544
Is my little girl April... I spent nights...

798
00:58:09,204 --> 00:58:09,874
Denied.

799
00:58:10,624 --> 00:58:12,255
You not going to think it's that easy,
Do you?

800
00:58:14,364 --> 00:58:17,722
I just wish that April
saw me as more a real man.

801
00:58:28,576 --> 00:58:29,536
Holy shit...

802
00:58:30,846 --> 00:58:32,398
You're right. The Network is not behind it.

803
00:58:33,528 --> 00:58:35,105
This is something. A helluva lot bigger.

804
00:58:36,443 --> 00:58:40,729
You've got enough here to bring down everyone.

805
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:40,289
The Senator, Booth...

806
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:43,613
Van...

807
00:58:44,864 --> 00:58:45,864
Look here.

808
00:58:46,123 --> 00:58:49,139
There's drug money financing the Senator's campaign.

809
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:55,091
Rogelio Torrez.

810
00:58:57,351 --> 00:58:58,289
Torrez...

811
00:58:59,815 --> 00:59:02,540
He's the drug kingpin who's been trying to gain
control of the drug trade.

812
00:59:03,736 --> 00:59:06,684
this must be the border fence
McLaughlin wants to build.

813
00:59:10,188 --> 00:59:11,402
See this?

814
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,581
These markings show the weakest spots.

815
00:59:14,788 --> 00:59:15,868
It all makes sense now.

816
00:59:16,373 --> 00:59:18,498
Torrez wants to get Senator McLaughlin re-elected,

817
00:59:18,499 --> 00:59:21,643
so that he can build a border fence that he
can control.

818
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:25,610
You did good work Machete.

819
00:59:25,611 --> 00:59:27,992
I bet you're a great cop.

820
00:59:28,347 --> 00:59:29,525
The best.

821
00:59:29,795 --> 00:59:30,823
And modest too.

822
00:59:32,017 --> 00:59:33,435
I'm dry.

823
00:59:40,486 --> 00:59:40,990
Get up.

824
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:43,037
Why?

825
00:59:44,376 --> 00:59:45,385
Because you're drunk.

826
00:59:50,831 --> 00:59:53,085
Come be with me.

827
01:00:16,909 --> 01:00:17,909
Speak english?

828
01:00:18,674 --> 01:00:20,570
Depends on the question.

829
01:00:22,284 --> 01:00:24,818
We know that you hired that Mexican to kill our senator.

830
01:00:26,396 --> 01:00:27,933
You the Network? Ain't cha?

831
01:00:29,138 --> 01:00:30,771
Hell! You're behind everything.

832
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:32,694
That's not how we work.

833
01:00:34,328 --> 01:00:35,577
But if you want war...

834
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:37,884
I will give it to you.

835
01:00:43,336 --> 01:00:44,836
How about an eye for an eye?

836
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:53,184
You burned your last burrito.

837
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:58,519
You got to get better at this, Billy.

838
01:01:59,643 --> 01:02:01,738
Please, Father, have mercy.

839
01:02:01,432 --> 01:02:04,795
God has mercy, I don't

840
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:13,506
Hello Padre (Father).

841
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:25,994
The Blood of Christ?
Taste like Merlot to me.

842
01:03:28,249 --> 01:03:30,336
Where is he?

843
01:03:30,684 --> 01:03:32,514
He's everywhere.

844
01:03:34,116 --> 01:03:35,521
Talk Padre.

845
01:03:36,117 --> 01:03:39,981
Sing me one of those Mexican hymns
like a chroming arch boy.

846
01:03:40,221 --> 01:03:41,663
Go to hell.

847
01:03:54,482 --> 01:03:57,610
You want to be a martyr?
I'm good at making martyrs.

848
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,074
Like Senator McLaughlin?

849
01:04:00,833 --> 01:04:02,004
That's right.

850
01:04:01,856 --> 01:04:04,611
We have to get that Senator re-elected.
Get that fence built along the border.

851
01:04:04,612 --> 01:04:06,451
before it is too late.

852
01:04:07,092 --> 01:04:08,783
You really hate our kind that much?

853
01:04:09,151 --> 01:04:13,000
No padre, I hate declining profits that much.

854
01:04:13,744 --> 01:04:16,406
An open border allows supply of flowing too easily.

855
01:04:16,893 --> 01:04:18,539
Drives our prices down.

856
01:04:18,736 --> 01:04:23,190
Restricted border limits supply.
Drives the prices up.

857
01:04:23,515 --> 01:04:26,327
Higher price, higher profits.

858
01:04:26,354 --> 01:04:30,149
You are drunk with power,
even putting the hit on your own boss.

859
01:04:32,778 --> 01:04:34,709
Just to boost his election numbers.

860
01:04:37,033 --> 01:04:38,763
Last chance, amigo.

861
01:04:40,224 --> 01:04:42,836
Where's Machete and
where are my wife and daughter?

862
01:04:46,697 --> 01:04:48,561
In hell.

863
01:04:51,876 --> 01:04:53,348
Then give them my best.

864
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:22,059
A real gentleman.

865
01:05:37,305 --> 01:05:38,291
Comfortable...

866
01:06:41,407 --> 01:06:43,070
Are they the same?

867
01:06:45,756 --> 01:06:47,944
They want you dead too.

868
01:06:48,898 --> 01:06:50,338
My brother.

869
01:06:51,213 --> 01:06:52,418
Wait!

870
01:07:23,522 --> 01:07:25,064
How do you text with this thing?

871
01:07:30,809 --> 01:07:31,897
I thought Machete don't text.

872
01:07:36,205 --> 01:07:37,546
Machete improvise.

873
01:07:43,333 --> 01:07:44,580
Where're you going?

874
01:07:46,281 --> 01:07:47,726
Take out the trash.

875
01:08:08,705 --> 01:08:10,200
Machete, sent me a text.

876
01:08:10,657 --> 01:08:12,220
What's it say?

877
01:08:13,178 --> 01:08:17,362
You just fuck with the wrong Mexican.

878
01:08:18,774 --> 01:08:20,146
He's coming after us.

879
01:08:20,411 --> 01:08:23,323
No, he's coming after you.

880
01:08:26,237 --> 01:08:27,731
You got some news?

881
01:08:27,774 --> 01:08:28,764
Yes.

882
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:31,423
His brother's is dead.

883
01:08:31,424 --> 01:08:32,836
You killed a priest.

884
01:08:32,837 --> 01:08:33,837
Congratulations.

885
01:08:36,619 --> 01:08:39,102
That's right Booth, I'm in your town.

886
01:08:39,103 --> 01:08:41,296
And I'm gonna kill Machete.

887
01:08:41,805 --> 01:08:43,098
And you're gonna watch it happen.

888
01:08:43,525 --> 01:08:45,959
And it will be the last you see.

889
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:46,996
Wait a second.

890
01:08:47,602 --> 01:08:49,430
There's a girl from ICE.

891
01:08:49,533 --> 01:08:51,955
She's with Machete and they have a file on me,

892
01:08:51,956 --> 01:08:54,319
on you, on McLaughlin, on everybody.

893
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:58,073
She can make things
very difficult for us.

894
01:08:58,207 --> 01:09:00,070
Where is she?

895
01:09:00,105 --> 01:09:03,220
You know, I've been thinking.

896
01:09:03,949 --> 01:09:05,660
We let these people into our homes,

897
01:09:05,661 --> 01:09:07,598
Watch our kids,

898
01:09:07,732 --> 01:09:10,086
park our cars.

899
01:09:10,648 --> 01:09:12,361
But we won't let them, into our country.

900
01:09:13,385 --> 01:09:15,147
Does that make any sense to you?

901
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:17,844
Hey! That wetback whack the both of us over the head.

902
01:09:17,641 --> 01:09:19,862
In case you forgot, he shot me in the leg.

903
01:09:20,104 --> 01:09:22,358
I thought Jango shot you?

904
01:09:22,493 --> 01:09:24,089
I don't want to hear that story again.

905
01:09:24,366 --> 01:09:25,097
Think about it.

906
01:09:25,239 --> 01:09:26,903
He wasn't here for us.

907
01:09:27,265 --> 01:09:28,342
He's here for the boss.

908
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:32,344
I've been watching the boss. This guy
is a real scumbag.

909
01:09:32,398 --> 01:09:33,434
Hey, hey, hey.

910
01:09:33,818 --> 01:09:35,665
Where's your loyalty at?

911
01:09:44,152 --> 01:09:45,748
Did you hear that?

912
01:09:47,852 --> 01:09:49,191
It's weed whacker.

913
01:09:49,073 --> 01:09:50,774
He's back!
Spread out.

914
01:09:51,199 --> 01:09:52,188
Spread out NOW!

915
01:10:10,992 --> 01:10:11,642
Alpha unit, you copy?

916
01:10:16,786 --> 01:10:18,191
Quit!

917
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:25,223
Anybody report.
You hear me?

918
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:27,094
Anybody?

919
01:10:35,376 --> 01:10:37,073
Where's Booth?

920
01:10:36,195 --> 01:10:37,654
The senator, his with the senator.

921
01:10:38,404 --> 01:10:39,462
I have a GPS.

922
01:10:40,863 --> 01:10:41,610
Tracks his limo.

923
01:10:42,092 --> 01:10:44,638
Hey! Don't kill me, please, take it.

924
01:10:51,088 --> 01:10:55,340
That's Spanish, "I let you live. "

925
01:10:55,867 --> 01:10:58,344
Thanks Chief

926
01:11:00,741 --> 01:11:02,344
Let me see if I am hearing you right.

927
01:11:02,462 --> 01:11:04,376
One of the city's most prominent businessmen.

928
01:11:04,377 --> 01:11:05,377
A Texas vigilante.

929
01:11:06,114 --> 01:11:09,957
The most notorious drug kingpin of Mexico
and a state senator,

930
01:11:09,958 --> 01:11:13,033
are all conspiring to enact stricter immigration laws?

931
01:11:13,239 --> 01:11:16,743
I know how it sounds, but I have Booth
on video committing a murder.

932
01:11:16,744 --> 01:11:17,843
I have tons of confessions.

933
01:11:17,844 --> 01:11:18,681
I mean it's...

934
01:11:19,121 --> 01:11:24,784
Listen to yourself, this man is an illegal alien,
ILLEGAL as in against the law.

935
01:11:25,494 --> 01:11:28,627
Well, there's the law and there's what's right.

936
01:11:32,881 --> 01:11:34,163
I'm gonna do what's right.

937
01:11:51,448 --> 01:11:54,302
<i> We are live from the Church of Hope
where just moments ago. </i>

938
01:11:54,175 --> 01:11:56,193
<i> Police discovered a gruesome murder. </i>

939
01:11:56,194 --> 01:11:58,596
<i> The body of a priest
was found nailed to the cross. </i>

940
01:11:58,597 --> 01:12:01,382
<i> And witnesses descriptions of
a man leaving the church. </i>

941
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:04,458
<i> Match those of a gunman wanted for the
shooting of Senator McLaughlin. </i>

942
01:12:04,555 --> 01:12:07,190
Excuse me, honey's just shut the door
and give us a moment.

943
01:12:07,535 --> 01:12:09,265
<i> On the street, they call him Machete. </i>

944
01:12:09,266 --> 01:12:11,462
<i> Who is he, what is he? </i>

945
01:12:11,463 --> 01:12:13,304
<i> And will he ever be brought down? </i>

946
01:12:13,844 --> 01:12:14,439
Where the fuck have you been?

947
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,724
This story is burning the whole fucking town to the ground.

948
01:12:16,725 --> 01:12:18,358
It's giving us a war that I
know we can win!

949
01:12:18,421 --> 01:12:20,370
He's a cockroach, sooner or later he'll
be squashed.

950
01:12:20,371 --> 01:12:20,679
Oh, oh, yeah!

951
01:12:20,646 --> 01:12:22,639
Well, this roach has got AK-47's

952
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,929
and he's laying waste to everything
that get's in his fucking path.

953
01:12:24,804 --> 01:12:26,574
I'm taking care of it.

954
01:12:26,636 --> 01:12:28,435
They scheduled me for release in
a couple of minutes...

955
01:12:28,436 --> 01:12:31,391
I can't walk outta here like a fucking piñata
waiting to get whacked.

956
01:12:31,392 --> 01:12:33,133
The man they are calling Machete...
- We're ready for you Senator.

957
01:12:35,256 --> 01:12:38,168
It's show time...

958
01:12:40,768 --> 01:12:41,729
You forgot your cane, sir.

959
01:12:46,708 --> 01:12:47,623
Ladies and gentlemen,

960
01:12:47,957 --> 01:12:51,478
Senator John McLaughlin.

961
01:12:57,547 --> 01:12:58,698
Thank you, thank you.

962
01:13:00,798 --> 01:13:04,036
This freehold danzito is not any closer to justice.

963
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:07,868
I "urge" this criminal and
those that are hiding him,

964
01:13:07,432 --> 01:13:08,455
to turn him in.

965
01:13:08,842 --> 01:13:10,837
He's destroying us from the inside,

966
01:13:10,838 --> 01:13:12,585
like the plague that he is...

967
01:13:13,912 --> 01:13:17,276
We must not let
terrorist win.

968
01:13:17,277 --> 01:13:18,204
Senator?

969
01:13:18,205 --> 01:13:19,530
There are reports implicating,

970
01:13:19,531 --> 01:13:23,021
your advisors as having orchestrating
the assassination attempt.

971
01:13:23,484 --> 01:13:26,162
Would you care to comment?

972
01:13:27,771 --> 01:13:29,266
What now?

973
01:13:32,217 --> 01:13:34,733
<i>Want to be a martyr?
I am good at making martyrs. </i>

974
01:13:35,106 --> 01:13:36,704
<i> Like Senator McLaughlin? </i>

975
01:13:36,596 --> 01:13:37,627
<i> That's right. </i>

976
01:13:37,628 --> 01:13:40,741
<i> We have to get that Senator re-elected.
Get that fence built along the border. </i>

977
01:13:40,742 --> 01:13:41,742
<i> Before it's too late. </i>

978
01:13:42,507 --> 01:13:43,730
Or do you care to comment,

979
01:13:43,731 --> 01:13:45,202
on the shooting. That happened

980
01:13:45,203 --> 01:13:47,715
on the border
on the night of July 22nd?

981
01:13:48,987 --> 01:13:50,203
<i> Who is gonna stop us? </i>

982
01:13:50,204 --> 01:13:51,204
<i> I am! </i>

983
01:13:52,964 --> 01:13:54,144
<i> Welcome to the America. </i>

984
01:13:56,843 --> 01:13:58,061
<i> You catch all that? </i>

985
01:13:58,062 --> 01:14:01,154
<i> Burn me a DVD. Behind our supporters
are going to like that! </i>

986
01:14:01,155 --> 01:14:02,155
<i> A lot! </i>

987
01:14:04,764 --> 01:14:07,834
How about your connections with drug king pin
Rogelio Torrez?

988
01:14:08,083 --> 01:14:08,699
No further comment.

989
01:14:09,223 --> 01:14:09,774
I'm sorry, I just...

990
01:14:09,775 --> 01:14:12,161
Or the border vigilantes involved in running drugs?

991
01:14:14,667 --> 01:14:15,826
I think I'm having a heart attack.

992
01:14:16,012 --> 01:14:18,431
God dammit if you don't relax
you will have one.

993
01:14:28,555 --> 01:14:30,405
You jeopardize more than my career,

994
01:14:30,406 --> 01:14:31,423
We got cut back.

995
01:14:32,156 --> 01:14:33,185
He could have killed me.

996
01:14:32,979 --> 01:14:34,324
Not with that scope.

997
01:14:36,006 --> 01:14:37,930
You stupid son of a bitch...

998
01:14:37,156 --> 01:14:39,892
You pulled something like that
without consulting me?

999
01:14:40,337 --> 01:14:41,472
Who the fuck do you think you are?!

1000
01:14:41,641 --> 01:14:44,810
I'm the one who got your campaign financed.

1001
01:14:44,549 --> 01:14:46,575
Made you a political powerhouse.

1002
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:47,786
Your own personal Jesus.

1003
01:14:47,892 --> 01:14:48,828
So, you better get down on your knees,

1004
01:14:48,829 --> 01:14:50,214
and start praying for me to save your soul

1005
01:14:50,215 --> 01:14:52,588
Because I'm the only one who can at
this point!

1006
01:15:04,446 --> 01:15:06,500
Get the fuck out.

1007
01:15:35,972 --> 01:15:38,533
God dammit man,
why don't you just die?

1008
01:15:39,936 --> 01:15:40,897
It's gonna work.

1009
01:15:41,314 --> 01:15:42,275
We could have been rich.

1010
01:15:42,082 --> 01:15:44,051
Torrez.

1011
01:15:44,052 --> 01:15:45,904
Was stopping all those cheap shit from across the border.

1012
01:15:45,905 --> 01:15:46,905
Did I tell you that?

1013
01:15:45,254 --> 01:15:49,597
Can lead more than a tired pendejo (fool) with
a dime bag and a dream.

1014
01:15:50,491 --> 01:15:51,847
So we financed Van.

1015
01:15:49,098 --> 01:15:52,750
Giving them men guns.

1016
01:15:52,751 --> 01:15:53,711
The Vigilantes.

1017
01:15:54,791 --> 01:15:56,452
Our own little private border patrol.

1018
01:15:57,188 --> 01:15:59,892
But Torrez wanted all that chelada.

1019
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:02,401
So I thought why not let politics
do what guns couldn't.

1020
01:16:03,124 --> 01:16:07,544
Funny things is that I thought
it would be a peaceful solution.

1021
01:16:08,779 --> 01:16:10,361
None of that tortured taco.

1022
01:16:11,832 --> 01:16:12,628
Wait, wait...

1023
01:16:13,182 --> 01:16:14,182
Torrez is looking for you.

1024
01:16:14,263 --> 01:16:16,132
You find Van, you'll find Torrez.

1025
01:16:17,768 --> 01:16:19,014
Please...

1026
01:16:20,212 --> 01:16:20,634
Tell me...

1027
01:16:21,125 --> 01:16:22,568
where are my wife and daughter?

1028
01:16:24,736 --> 01:16:25,715
With God.

1029
01:16:27,054 --> 01:16:29,114
I guess I won't be seeing them.

1030
01:16:42,948 --> 01:16:44,577
Fuck! My head...

1031
01:16:47,403 --> 01:16:49,099
What is this shit?

1032
01:16:49,462 --> 01:16:51,105
That asshole drugged us.

1033
01:16:51,916 --> 01:16:52,916
Where are our clothes?

1034
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:55,646
Call daddy.

1035
01:17:09,014 --> 01:17:09,480
It's June,

1036
01:17:10,832 --> 01:17:11,832
and April.

1037
01:17:13,053 --> 01:17:15,078
We're very sorry.

1038
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:16,664
Your husband is dead.

1039
01:17:18,091 --> 01:17:19,137
He's what?

1040
01:17:18,885 --> 01:17:20,469
Senator McLaughlin shot him.

1041
01:17:38,307 --> 01:17:41,331
Secure that weapon!
Yeah!

1042
01:17:41,638 --> 01:17:44,181
<i> Vigilante leader, Van Jackson has
refused declined comment, </i>

1043
01:17:44,182 --> 01:17:46,577
<i> after startling revelations of their connections,  </i>

1044
01:17:46,578 --> 01:17:47,596
<i> to the Mexican drug cartels. </i>

1045
01:17:48,762 --> 01:17:49,723
This is Van...

1046
01:17:49,267 --> 01:17:50,240
I'm coming in.

1047
01:17:50,241 --> 01:17:52,319
We're all over the news senator...

1048
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,723
You compromised everything we worked for.

1049
01:17:55,268 --> 01:17:56,590
There is only one way this is gonna end.

1050
01:17:56,591 --> 01:17:57,591
smoke em' out.

1051
01:17:58,151 --> 01:18:00,015
But I wanna put a bullet in his head myself.

1052
01:18:00,769 --> 01:18:02,264
And just how you're figuring on doing that?

1053
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:05,805
I'm joining you boys for one last ride along.

1054
01:18:21,682 --> 01:18:22,682
Machete.

1055
01:18:23,651 --> 01:18:25,281
Where's Luz?

1056
01:18:27,468 --> 01:18:28,996
She's gone, man.

1057
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,474
Vigilante's got her.

1058
01:18:30,475 --> 01:18:32,034
And now they're after you.

1059
01:18:32,357 --> 01:18:33,425
You gotta lead us to fight,

1060
01:18:33,426 --> 01:18:34,763
it's what Luz would have want!

1061
01:18:34,615 --> 01:18:36,144
Not your war.

1062
01:18:36,736 --> 01:18:38,224
I maybe adopted as'say.

1063
01:18:38,634 --> 01:18:39,443
No shit.

1064
01:18:39,001 --> 01:18:41,664
What's going on, not right!

1065
01:18:42,097 --> 01:18:43,788
We just wanna help, bro.

1066
01:18:43,551 --> 01:18:45,079
I don't need your help.

1067
01:18:47,426 --> 01:18:48,410
Not us?

1068
01:18:49,829 --> 01:18:50,937
Then who?

1069
01:19:01,231 --> 01:19:02,182
Whatever you need.

1070
01:19:01,684 --> 01:19:04,033
Build it, strip it, chop it.

1071
01:19:05,024 --> 01:19:06,264
Garage's is yours, Homez...

1072
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:07,737
Got guns?

1073
01:19:07,624 --> 01:19:08,738
Si (yes).

1074
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:11,166
We missiles, machine guns.

1075
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:13,415
We fight Van, we fight Torrez.

1076
01:19:13,416 --> 01:19:15,379
We take em' all down at once.

1077
01:19:15,968 --> 01:19:16,906
Hey everyone!

1078
01:19:17,361 --> 01:19:17,753
Listen UP!

1079
01:19:17,754 --> 01:19:18,754
Now we got some work to do!

1080
01:19:27,190 --> 01:19:28,190
Does anyone knows who's Machete?

1081
01:19:28,932 --> 01:19:29,932
Does anyone knows who's Machete?

1082
01:19:31,855 --> 01:19:32,855
Please.

1083
01:19:33,369 --> 01:19:34,714
Machete needs your help

1084
01:19:34,715 --> 01:19:36,360
or he'll be killed just like Luz,

1085
01:19:36,361 --> 01:19:37,361
just like Padre (Father).

1086
01:19:41,744 --> 01:19:42,866
Listen to me!

1087
01:19:44,068 --> 01:19:46,370
Yes, I am a woman of the law,

1088
01:19:46,371 --> 01:19:48,744
and there are lots of laws!

1089
01:19:49,303 --> 01:19:51,016
But if they don't offer us justice,

1090
01:19:51,017 --> 01:19:52,897
Then they aren't law!

1091
01:19:53,776 --> 01:19:55,447
They are just lines drawn in the sand

1092
01:19:55,448 --> 01:19:57,775
by men who would stand on your backs.

1093
01:19:58,206 --> 01:19:59,461
For power and glory.

1094
01:19:59,890 --> 01:20:02,713
Men who deserves to be cut down.

1095
01:20:04,294 --> 01:20:06,268
It's time to erase the meyette the line!

1096
01:20:07,311 --> 01:20:09,446
And show these cabronese the
true meaning of true law!

1097
01:20:11,126 --> 01:20:12,469
We didn't cross the border.

1098
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:15,541
The border crossed us!

1099
01:20:16,368 --> 01:20:17,639
Viva la (long live) Machete!

1100
01:20:18,712 --> 01:20:20,255
Viva la (long live) Machete!

1101
01:20:21,241 --> 01:20:22,523
You’re Machete's girl.

1102
01:20:22,524 --> 01:20:23,661
I know,

1103
01:20:23,662 --> 01:20:25,514
Unless you're his type.

1104
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,843
What type is that?

1105
01:20:27,982 --> 01:20:29,812
Dead.

1106
01:20:41,936 --> 01:20:44,679
<i> Earlier today, Senator McLaughlin allegedly pulled a gun, </i>

1107
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,211
<i> on his advisor Michael Booth. </i>

1108
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:48,246
<i> And shot him twice in the chest. </i>

1109
01:20:48,247 --> 01:20:50,603
<i> After an altercation following the disaster reveal </i>

1110
01:20:50,604 --> 01:20:52,725
<i> earlier this afternoon. Of the senator's </i>

1111
01:20:52,726 --> 01:20:53,726
<i> connections to the </i>

1112
01:20:53,382 --> 01:20:55,110
<i> Mexican drug king pin
Rogelio Torrez. </i>

1113
01:20:55,292 --> 01:20:56,631
Network!

1114
01:20:56,168 --> 01:20:57,177
<i> According to recent reports,</i>

1115
01:20:57,178 --> 01:21:00,031
<i> McLaughlin's re-election campaign was been funded </i>

1116
01:21:00,032 --> 01:21:01,893
<i> entirely by Mr. Torrez. </i>

1117
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:03,427
Machete!

1118
01:21:05,209 --> 01:21:08,145
Networks said the senator calling
the vigilantes to kill you.

1119
01:21:08,615 --> 01:21:09,679
And Agent Santana,

1120
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:11,693
she's been captured by Torrez!

1121
01:21:12,802 --> 01:21:15,413
All hands and the armory to load up.

1122
01:21:15,782 --> 01:21:17,345
Time to roll out!

1123
01:22:21,055 --> 01:22:22,353
Give me a vest and a rifle.

1124
01:22:26,677 --> 01:22:28,260
My great grand daddy...

1125
01:22:28,261 --> 01:22:31,011
did not give his life at at The Alamo
so that we could

1126
01:22:31,012 --> 01:22:34,621
sell off our nation to some
backstabbing politicians.

1127
01:22:35,011 --> 01:22:35,875
What are you talking about?

1128
01:22:36,366 --> 01:22:37,510
You lied to us,

1129
01:22:37,511 --> 01:22:39,578
you paid that Mexican to put on an act.

1130
01:22:39,579 --> 01:22:40,579
To fool the people.

1131
01:22:41,211 --> 01:22:42,806
And my pool of posse.

1132
01:22:43,053 --> 01:22:43,929
Now he's on his way...

1133
01:22:43,930 --> 01:22:46,353
And no doubt bringing a whole
mess of bean eaters.

1134
01:22:46,953 --> 01:22:49,598
You seem to be quite fond of Booth, Senator.

1135
01:22:49,358 --> 01:22:51,378
You've been in the desert too long amigo...

1136
01:22:51,486 --> 01:22:53,383
Well let's see just how this blows your skirt up?

1137
01:22:53,875 --> 01:22:57,620
We're gonna simulcast your execution
for the crime of treason.

1138
01:23:01,366 --> 01:23:03,080
No shit stains.

1139
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:07,735
Guys! They're on their way!

1140
01:23:08,474 --> 01:23:09,435
Get to your posts!

1141
01:23:21,018 --> 01:23:22,390
Time for your last testament.

1142
01:23:24,581 --> 01:23:26,869
No second takes.

1143
01:23:27,221 --> 01:23:28,499
Just get your lines right.

1144
01:23:55,667 --> 01:23:57,063
Hold the line...

1145
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:05,700
I have desecrated the oath of our first...

1146
01:24:06,322 --> 01:24:10,069
and I am a traitor deserving death.

1147
01:24:10,103 --> 01:24:11,056
Ready?

1148
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:14,273
Fucking parasites!

1149
01:24:14,779 --> 01:24:16,118
Fucking terrorists!

1150
01:24:17,247 --> 01:24:18,976
Aim.

1151
01:24:35,516 --> 01:24:36,888
Shit

1152
01:24:36,853 --> 01:24:37,624
Two of you stay with him...

1153
01:24:37,625 --> 01:24:38,625
The rest of you outside.

1154
01:24:47,486 --> 01:24:49,315
Oh shit!

1155
01:24:54,347 --> 01:24:56,300
Fuck em up!

1156
01:26:33,289 --> 01:26:34,249
How is your eye?

1157
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:35,211
What eye?

1158
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:19,562
If you want to survive your own war,

1159
01:27:19,563 --> 01:27:21,873
you better become Mexican real fast.

1160
01:27:25,166 --> 01:27:27,588
You got enemies on all sides, Senator.

1161
01:27:29,565 --> 01:27:31,785
Who can you trust?

1162
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,739
You aim to take down those boys?

1163
01:27:35,907 --> 01:27:37,003
Then I'm with you.

1164
01:28:09,436 --> 01:28:11,880
Take out that Mexican!

1165
01:28:12,856 --> 01:28:14,053
God Dammit!

1166
01:28:23,683 --> 01:28:26,005
Van, we're fucked! We
gotta get outta here.

1167
01:28:26,006 --> 01:28:27,006
Get outta here!

1168
01:28:44,930 --> 01:28:45,937
Sister...

1169
01:28:46,626 --> 01:28:47,708
Please...

1170
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:50,114
I've done wrong...

1171
01:28:50,739 --> 01:28:51,739
I've done terrible this life...

1172
01:28:52,584 --> 01:28:54,069
And I'm not even from here
I hate Texas.

1173
01:28:54,070 --> 01:28:55,070
I hate the heat.

1174
01:28:55,852 --> 01:28:57,389
Give me my last rites.

1175
01:28:59,863 --> 01:29:02,579
In the name of my father.

1176
01:29:03,131 --> 01:29:04,165
My father...

1177
01:29:05,643 --> 01:29:06,807
April.

1178
01:29:13,594 --> 01:29:14,560
Forgot the rest.

1179
01:30:12,495 --> 01:30:14,470
You never learn to stay down!
Punieta (jerk off).

1180
01:30:15,136 --> 01:30:16,838
So I guess I have to teach you.

1181
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:22,619
Got something to say?

1182
01:30:26,042 --> 01:30:27,868
Now you got something to say?

1183
01:30:38,132 --> 01:30:40,246
Back the fuck up and watch.

1184
01:30:43,605 --> 01:30:44,652
Okay Punieta!

1185
01:30:45,495 --> 01:30:46,650
Adelante (Forward).

1186
01:31:01,263 --> 01:31:03,262
We used to be federale's together
kanna (root),

1187
01:31:03,263 --> 01:31:04,263
Remember?

1188
01:31:09,298 --> 01:31:10,173
We were brothers...

1189
01:31:11,169 --> 01:31:11,920
But you?

1190
01:31:11,921 --> 01:31:14,008
went for the honor.

1191
01:31:14,009 --> 01:31:15,585
Pendejo (coward).

1192
01:31:24,522 --> 01:31:25,948
Then I went for the power.

1193
01:31:27,864 --> 01:31:29,978
We killed a lot
of bad guys together.

1194
01:31:32,032 --> 01:31:33,665
Now I'm the bad guy.

1195
01:31:35,015 --> 01:31:36,554
What do you wanna do?
hermanito (little brother)?

1196
01:31:47,834 --> 01:31:50,044
Look at your Machete now. Cabrón

1197
01:31:54,310 --> 01:31:55,463
He's gonna kill him.

1198
01:31:57,175 --> 01:31:58,616
No he's not.

1199
01:32:00,347 --> 01:32:01,500
He's Machete.

1200
01:32:06,113 --> 01:32:07,266
No point.

1201
01:32:16,324 --> 01:32:17,439
Cap Puto (fuck).

1202
01:32:19,518 --> 01:32:22,595
You know I could kill you now
very easily.

1203
01:32:23,581 --> 01:32:24,477
Believe me.

1204
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:26,785
This is nothing.

1205
01:32:29,092 --> 01:32:30,630
This ain't shit.

1206
01:32:31,105 --> 01:32:32,065
But...

1207
01:32:34,187 --> 01:32:37,742
I know you'll just be waiting for me in hell.

1208
01:32:37,839 --> 01:32:40,626
So...

1209
01:32:42,549 --> 01:32:43,702
I think I'll say goodbye.

1210
01:32:47,267 --> 01:32:48,487
Fuck it.

1211
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:17,181
There's one!

1212
01:34:18,510 --> 01:34:20,008
God damn cockroach

1213
01:34:32,008 --> 01:34:33,594
Can't speak english. Can you boy?

1214
01:34:37,768 --> 01:34:39,045
Welcome to America.

1215
01:35:26,934 --> 01:35:28,408
What? You wanna see my ID?

1216
01:35:28,409 --> 01:35:29,409
Don't bother.

1217
01:35:30,772 --> 01:35:32,039
I've got something better.

1218
01:35:34,768 --> 01:35:35,826
I called in a few favours.

1219
01:35:35,827 --> 01:35:36,827
Look at this.

1220
01:35:37,466 --> 01:35:38,937
Got you all the right papers.

1221
01:35:39,907 --> 01:35:41,295
You can start over now.

1222
01:35:42,032 --> 01:35:43,377
Be a real person.

1223
01:35:43,938 --> 01:35:45,410
Why do I want to be a real person?

1224
01:35:46,833 --> 01:35:48,563
I'm already a myth.

1225
01:35:49,542 --> 01:35:50,695
Where will you go?

1226
01:35:52,777 --> 01:35:54,602
Everywhere.

1227
01:35:58,911 --> 01:36:00,737
Can I ride with you?
